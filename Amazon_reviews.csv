"I am using this neck band about past 12 days and writing my review. I used this earphone with bike travel,  pubg , alone in room, noisy crowded places and in office. i am writing this review from my own perspective. Medium level of volume (60%) is enough for me through the day for call and music and it have charge upto one and half day.1.Good audio quality-  4/52.Decent Bass - 4/53.Good battery backup  - 4/54.Quality material -  5/55.Ergonomics - 4.5/56.Mic - 2/57.Gaming - 4.5/5.Everything in this product is fine until online call comes. It have two mic on the headphone. i don't know which one is pickup the noise in online call. when we use this headphone for online calls the mic works absolutely terrible for me. It is very responsive and pickup the tiny noise very far from the mic and not picking up my voice. i tried with wtsapp, Duo,Skype and Zoom call. It is frustrating for me all the times.I checked with one of my colleague's earphone it do have the same issue as mine.Noise cancellation during bike drive works is still not up to satisfying. it work sometimes and most of the time the opponent hear only wind noise. I tried to block the wind by placing the neckband below my shirt's collar,, still wind noise is there. Apart from that, the mic works decent in normal calls.During PUBG, i don't feel any latency issue with this and also no audio or mic issue."
"Overall a good earphone but not a good sounding headphone.If you're looking for anything that sounds good, has natural lows , warm and and deep mids, sparkling and clear highs ? Go for anything but not this. Soundstage wise , they're horrible, bass is artificial, there is absolutely no imaging. The depth in the audio sounds like a 8bit Audio played on 1995 Walkman. Highs are absolutely absent. This is just very very bad sounding headphone.But, if you don't care about Audio Quality in the Music and like anything that has good battery, charges superfast, sleek and well built, produces stupid bass for IDK what reason. Then you might like it.I don't like it and I won't recommend it. (Tested on 24bit 96khz FLAC/ALAC files)"
"I received package but in box I got a broken data cable. Amazon again defaulter with its service.After got my refund, I purchased it from local shop. I impressed with its design and flexibility around the neck. Sound also great. But with in 15 days left side part stopped working and this time I surprised because I'm the person who cares alot of my products. One plus service center changed it and provide me a new earphone.If you are thinking to purchase it..no doubt it's a great product.It's produced a balance sound that's all."
"In the previous model, we could easily switch between two connected devices. While hearing  TV / laptop/ ipad output on the Bluetooth, one could switch to the phone or any other connected device  with just a double click on the power button. This was such a super useful feature of this device in the previous version. THE NEW MODEL DOES NOT  HAVE THAT OPTION!! I tried  all possibilities and read through the manual.. No .. NOT AVAILABLE!! This is. Ridiculous and feel so cheated.. how could they strip off such an important and very USEFUL feature!  I am appalled and deeply disappointed.  Can’t return it.. only replacement is allowed. !! How could the company be so stupid and thoughtless."
"Built - good built as expected, band is soft silicone, one side three button control with charging port which shockingly have no cover on it, all other cheaper alternative have.Connection - no issues fast seamless,Sound - main features is sound quality, as it is bass edition, so mote than enough bass, compared to other owned earbuds like cross beats evolve not as par to it, it sound like a SMALL SPEAKER IS SOUNDING A FULL SOUND, whereas boat rokerz 385v2 sound like a big home theatre system sounding, and sound is not balanced as it is bass edition.Bass, mids, vocals can heard clearly and separately but quality not up towards crossbeats.Charging - super fast,Verdict - other alternative at cheaper price bracket like boat, noise can be recommended over this."
"Excellent headphones. I use them a lot - listening to podcasts when I'm pottering, music when I'm running, for every phone call and video conference. The ...The warp charging is amazing - combined with the automatic off when they dangle round your neck (magnetic buds), it means I just never run out of battery. 10 mins of charging keeps them going for a couple of days of use for me.They connect to my phone automatically and very quickly when I snap them apart. A button on the neck band switches the connection quickly to my laptop and back.Sound quality is excellent and they're pretty comfy. The fit in my ear isn't quite as good as I've had with some other in-ear headphones, but they stay in well enough for use on long cross-country runs."
This is my second purchase of this earphone. This is a great earphone.Pros-------Great sound quality (4/5)Bass is excellent (5/5)Call quality (5/5) - so far nobody complained about my calls and it is crystal clear.Noise cancellation good (4/5)Comfort in the ears (4/5) - please choose the earbuds according to your comfort. The small one looked more comfortable for me.Battery backup is excellent (5/5) - You can easily get 12-15 hours of playback/call time.Magnet ON/OFF switch is great - this helps in not using the battery when magnetic switch is paired. With medium to heavy usage the battery last for 3+ days easily.Fast pairing is great.Build quality is excellentCons-------No switch for pairing with multiple devices. You need to manually do this.Even though the earbuds are comfortable you may feel slight discomfort after using it for longer period continuously.Highly recommended for anybody who is looking for a decent Bluetooth headset.
It is wrong on part of Amazon to club multiple products into one and project ratings together as one. Also when it is updated it should be sold as a different item if the features are considerably changed. The ratings also become misleading here.The previous version of this product had a smart switch. It allowed you to toggel between two different phones/devices. E.g. you are listening to music from your laptop and receive a call on your mobile. Simple click that button and take the call. Now this button has been removed which is a big disappointment.

 The item delivered is a fake earphone and used one. It is not even a OnePlus earphone, seems like a local used earphone. It is very disappointing to receive a fake product disguised as one plus. The package is also open. I have raised a return for this immediately and have raised a complaint against this sort of delivery. Do not buy this product."
"After one month of use, honest review.Everything is good sound, battery backup, connectivity, look and noise cancelation but Chinese product remains Chinese.Sorry to say but the volume, play/pause button fell off suddenly somewhere while neckband was in my ear and it shows no sign before so that I could have fixed it.It just fell off.Everything still works fine but I don't have buttons to increase/decrease volume, play or pause In neck band."
When you want to dream about something while watching videos or PRETENDING TO BE SEEING THE NEWS AND STUDYING.IT'S AN EXCELLENT WAY TO GET YOUR OWN SENSES DOING WHAT YOU WANT OR YOUR BRAIN WANTS TO DO... USE THESE HEADPHONES... WOW.. I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF THE TREBLE MIDRANGE AND BASS SOUNDS AND THE SOUND OF THE AUDIENCE IN THE LIVE MUSIC VIDEOS... BUT YOU TEND TO DREAM MORE THAN WORK.. IF YOU TOTAL YOUR WORK AFTERWARDS WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS... 🎧🍷💭🎶🎵🎼😳👀..THAT'S SOUND SCIENCE TOO GOOD KEEP IT UP... WOW...

 Very bad product quality.I did buyed two Oneplus bullet Z headphone due to good noise cancellation for wfh. Both both stopped working within a month out no where. 1st one mic stopped working, and for second one headphone total dead. Only good thing is with lots of hassle you can get a replacement which takes near about 15days."
"I had high expectations from these as I am a loyal user of JBL, bought these basically for office calls as the battery backup was good, after using them for approx 2 weeks I can say I am disappointed. Earphones aren't very comfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes due to the shape of it, listening to music is a  bad experience feels like you're using some 50rs cheap headphones the only good thing i battery, everything else is just a pain. Please don't buy these"
"I have been using them for a year and half. And here is my review:Pros:Strong build quality- i often fall asleep wearing them and have travelled so much with them but there hasn't been any wear tear on the earphones.Fast charging- 15 minutes is enough to completely charge them with a one plus charger. If you're in hurry then put it for 2-3 minutes and I would work for hours.Great battery- along with fast charging the battery back to is great. It can with for upto 24-36 hours non stop.Noise cancellation- This is a big thumbs up for those who are looking for an earphone majorly for call purpose. It has good noise cancellation and the sound is captured perfectly.Packing- comes with good packing, you can considering giving it to someone for gift.Cons- Not a good choice for music. It doesn't have good bass which I am sure a lot of people look for when it comes to music."
"Pros:Best in class sound and great bassGood for all music genresReasonable priceGood balance of mids, lows. The upper highs are little muffed and could be a problem for hard rock lovers. But you can make any headphones work as per your needs with the equalizer on your device.Cons:One star less because they didn’t put the quick switch button on these ones. The old ones without the bass edition had a quick switch button. I can live with that but the convenience is missing in these ones. My solution press and hold the middle button and then switch in the mobile device for connecting."
"Cummon OnePlus, what the hell are these!!!They are supposed to be the ""Bass Edition"", however, there's NO BASS. Absolutely disgusted with the sound signature. The highs are killing my ears, feels like I have placed really crap tweeters in my brain. DAMN... This was a bad purchase!Updated: After one day if use, crackling sound on calls, disconnects and reconnects to the phone on its own, it is super irritating. No return policy on the this one, have asked for a replacement.Update (Replacement Unit): Absolutely horrible product. The same issues as the previous unit. STAY AWAY!!!"
"It is good in all aspects. I purchased 4 numbers of OnePlus Bullets Bluetooth Wireless Z Bass Edition in Ear Earphones with Mic (Black) for me and my friends. The performance of the sets is good and the battery charge is sufficient for the full day. For one of the sets, Magnet was dropped and lost somewhere after 10 months of usage. Replacement is denied as the magnet is not found. Another set stopped pairing after 2 Months. Oneplus service center replaced it with a new set on my request."
"This review I am writing after 1 month usage. Firstly let me say that I am a moderate user of this item. I used this Bluetooth headset for calls, audios and music.Pros:1. One plus being an elite brand has tried to maintain a decent quality of the product.2. Bass & Treble performance - deep bass delivery is satisfactory. High pitched notes could be made better. I am a fan of Jagjit Singh and his ghazals were all upto my satisfactory levels.3. Tried it using inside trains. At 75% volume level outside noises were mostly eleminated. Outdoor ambient noise was also blocked when used during brisk walking or trolling. Choice of volume level is upto the hearing perception of an user. So I am not commenting more on this.4. Call reception quality is good enough.5. If you use it at night in a dark room with some classical songs playing....simply you will love to continue to play.6. Lastly the sound delivery does not distort even at higher volumes which is a great positive factor to me.7. Battery backup is satisfactory. It never runs out of charge. After 2 hrs of listening charge dips 10% only which is acceptable.Cons:1. It could be made a bit sturdy at this price.2. The thin round wires coming out from the headband will tend to tear at that place because it is a weak joint. It could be made better.Overall if you can spare a bit much from the ranges around 1100-1300 then this won't turn you down. I am happy using this item as of now.Choice is yours. Best of luck."
"The product is good overall..1, Battery : The battery life is best. It really gives 10 hours charge with 10 minutes charge. It has fast charging facility. For battery, there is nothing to worry.2, Sound and bass: It has high bass..But I personally don't like it for the bass. If you are a music lover, you can feel the vocals and other instrumental sound are slightly distorted for the bass, I say slightly, not so high .If you want a balanced audio stay away from it, or you can use the regular edition. But if you are a bass lover, thats a perfect option for you. And I feel a little crack audio while listening to music. That's can be for my phone problem, because, when I connect it with my laptop, there is no such problem. So, I think to return it.  There is no quick switch option in the bass edition.  That may be helpful for you to buying it."
"The earphones are great for music, can't deny that. And they worked great for calls as well, for the first few months. But later, they started developing these issues where it would create a really disturbing noise during calls which both you and the other person can hear. So bad that you'd prefer talking on the handset rather than bear that sound. YouTube is filled with solution videos and comment sections filled with this same issue. So this problem is not unique to my case. This was not expected from OnePlus. What does one even do with great sound quality when they have to disconnect the earphones every time they get a phone call? This is a highly frustrating experience."
"Writing this review after 5 days:Oneplus did a great job with this earphones.Sound Quality: Sound and Bass are Amazing as mentioned everywhere. Comfortable for all type of uses like Calling, Music, Movies, etc.Build Quality: Such a premium build quality, not gonna break easily and with nicely box packing, every essential items are given like extra earbuds and charging cable. It feels very light wearing it, You can wear it all day without any problem.Eveything is great with this, only I had a problem with in-ear-fitting as the earbuds are little bit of big for my ears, I solved the problem by changing the earbuds to small ones.Conculsion: Over all it's a good product if you're looking for a good neckband earphones. I totally recommend it under ₹2k (Worth It) 👍"
"The first pair I ordered had an issue in the left ear plaug and I got the headset replaced.The repclement worked fine for 2 days. It lasted only 30-45 mins of use. I assumed I was not charging them enough.Now its been on charge for the last 5 hrs and its not powering up.Can be a unique case, howvever it takes away my confidence from the brand."
"This review is not for amazon or the customer service but for the oneplus warranty claim process. First of all once you contact the oneplus warranty helpline they will ask for your original box of the bluetooth earphones whoch you received a year ago(which totally doesn't make sense for anyone to keep the cardboard box with you forever) for the product to be eligible for warranty even if it is under 1 year warraanty terms. secondly, you need to be on a call for 35 mins to install an all new app to book for a service later which will get rejected for some dumb reason. The whole process of applying for warranty is an pain in the a*s in oneplus. I would suggest you to apt for some other brand for a better quality of service. Oneplus warranty claim process sucks."
"Guys its sound is not much impressive, I have used realme ear piece which is of 1400 bucks. Sound and mic quality is far better in realme compare to this 2000 bucks of one plus. I am feeling like i wasted the money and product is not up to the mark.Dont go for it. Its really not that good as youtubers are claiming for it. It sound like just an average ear piece which you can get in 1k product. Mic quality is some what above that average still NOT VALUE FOR MONEY.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY FOR THIS."
"build Quality - 8/10LightweightBASS is ok in this model as well, not much bass you will feel but still good it will save yourear.Sound Quality- PC Windows 10- 5/10 (Very Low Sound tested in HP Zbook)- iPhone  - 9/10- Android - 9/10 (I don't have 1+ phone )- Samsung Android Phone - Sometimes Disconnection issue is identified- Mac - 9/10Call Quality -- PC Windows 10- 5/10- Iphone  - 9/10- Android - 9/10 (I don't have 1+ phone )- Samsung Android Phone - Sometimes Disconnection issue is identified otherwise (9/10)- Mac - 0/10 - received call from facetime - cannot talk , low voice is reaching to the caller.Connection Speed -- Windows 10 PC - Takes Some time to connect 8/10- MAC immediately connects (9/10)- iPhone (9/10)- Samsung phone (9/10)"
"Sound - ExcellentNoise cancellation - GreatBass - perfectBattery - best in classFit - I see this as the only challenge... Though it fits well in your ears, the challenge I observe is when we have to use it for long... It happens to hurt your ears a bit because iktye size is exactly as your ears, design is great but the hard part of the earphones starts hurting after a couple hrs use.. may be it would fit some oneelses ears perfectly well, infact it's a good fit to my earas as well but yes I do have to just the earplugs after a couple hrs continous useRest everyhing is unmatched"
Overall Good product but When travelling Outdoors the Noise Cancellation is almost Zero.Firstly Dont buy this product if you always use it Outdoors because the Noise Cancellation is Almost Zero.The opponent cant hear your Voice clearly because of Background Noise.Apart from This the Earphones are amazing in terms if Sound Quality.
All thos Mother!@#$%^&* who aporeciated this one plus product mast have done it for paid.its no where near to realme earphone which comes in 1799 ..only problem with realme earphone is that its wire used to break from the main machine ...or else i would have bought realme earphone for third time in 2 years....but i bought this One plus product in 2000 rupees which is just a trash .One plus is useless earphone
"This the replacement of the fault one. I bought for fire time to gift my wife and eventually it failed to work within two days. But I crossed the replacement period. Still after explaining Amazon representative, they accepted to replace and provide me a new one. I mean, the Amazon representative guy was very helpful. The replacement one is working excellent. Thank you Amazon"
"This is the best bluetooth earphone I have ever used. Unmatched sound quality, ease switch between songs / connecting or disconnecting calls.The best thing about this is the battery back up. Literal 5-10 minutes of charging would give a 100% charge.  Although it depends on the usage, but a moderate use can still make the battery last for 3-4 days. I love the magnet at the end of the earbuds to save the chare.You don't need to think twice before getting this one if you are looking to buy a good quality bluetooth earphones."
"Pretty good and decent Bluetooth device. I am very happy with the sound quality and the fast connection. Really happy with the magnetic on/off feature as this helped me a lot. In the other bluetooth devices, when the device is paired but not on your ears, you don't hear the ringing if one calls using MS Teams. Here as you can keep the device off when you remove from your ears, you don't miss it. However, at times, the earpiece gets disconnected from the other especially when you move your hands. Also, at times, the length is a bit nuisance. Also, feel that it would be even better if the battery life could be higher..  At times, the battery lasts only one day, but able to manage."
"Though the sound/bass quality is good, the product is very unreliable and flimsy. Right side buds stopped working within 2 days of purchase. Also, there was a cracking noise heard during phonecalls which is very disturbing. Got a free replacement from Amazon as per their policy. The replaced product also had the same issues. Was denied another round of replacement by Amazon, thus had to visit a OnePlus exclusive service center. They took more than a week's time and gave a replacement which they claimed to be a new product. These ""new"" earphones won't get charged and are unusable. OnePlus is not offering pickup-drop service for repair due some technical issues. Highly disappointed with the entire turn of events and experience. Total waste of time and money."
"I like the prduct due to its sound quality and the amout of noise cancellation that it provides at this price point.However, online meetings at laptops and computers revealed an potential issue with this. If you are infront of the laptop (may be within 2-3 feet) other will not notice any issue. As soon as you move beyond that you are not audible or your voice will decrease significantly for others in the call, forcing you to maintain the very small radius. This negates the purpose of having  Bluetooth headphones.So, for cellphone its ok but for office meetings you will face issues."
"Average quality. Not worth spending 2000 on this headphones. I read in one of the review that the headphones produce a cracking sound. I ignored it thinking that it would be one very random case. But, to my dismay, the pair that I received always produces a cracking sound while increasing, decreasing the sound or when switching over to a new song. Couldn't help but there it away and bought the Jabra 45t. Much much better than one plus"

"The lack of the good one 'Quick Switch' button is the main problem. I used the original edition for 1.5 years and it got wear off due to heavy usage and I had to purchase a new one and I bought this one few days back and I am okay with the purchase but the main problem is the missing of 'Quick Switch' button and I never thought that would be an issue but it sincerely bothering me just too much that I have to leave a single star review for its successor.We few compare original edition with this bass edition:Quick switchOld: YesNew: NoBattery backupOld: 2.5 to 3 daysNew: 2 daysBass (rating 1-10)Old: 8New: 8.5 (it's not worth the hype)Charging timeOld: 1-1.2 hoursNew: 1-1.2 hours (Its the same)Convenience (1-10)Old: 10New: -1 (lack of that damn quick switch)My final rating for original and bass edition (1-10)Old: 9.8New: 6.5Conclusion: Go for the original edition if possible, if you haven't used to quick switch this one might be fine for you but if you constantly listen on your computer and switch to your phone for call or something the quick switch button will ease up the pairing task to such an ultimate level.If the review help, give a LIKE for being a savior :)"
"I had used the original Bullets Wireless Z for around 14 months. And never needed to use anything else. Although I have a pair of Sony WH1000XM3, but they were convenient enough to accept the worse audio quality. My originals started giving me issues with the mic and remote. Which was caused by usage in light rain as far as I can tell. So I got the new one. I initially thought that the only thing different between the two was the audio tuning. Sadly, I was wrong.First of all, whats similar between the originals and bass edition.Same comfort- Can comfortably wear it for hours without fatigue.Support for Warp ChargingPrice.What's not same?1) Significantly cheaper build. Since, I have both the versions, I can compare the two side-by-side. It's lighter but not in a good way. The wires feel flimsier.2) No quick-switch button- It was such a huge game changer for me. I used the original Zs with my phone and laptop and could switch back and forth between the two without having to fiddle around the settings. Although now you can connect to 3 devices simultaneously, which is a feature that I like and will use, but I am not sure how relevant it is for others.3) Worse battery life- Just by the specs, the company quotes lower battery life. This is a bummer as the improvement in audio quality is barely noticeable when compared to the decrease in battery life.4) Worse latency- I had used the Original Zs with oneplus 7T and 9 pro and nothing could beat the latency on the originals. While playing PUBG on pro-gaming mode, the latency was imperceivable. But here, it is certainly noticeable. Let's see if this can be improved with a software update down the line, as it did for the original Zs.5) Positioning on the mic- The original Zs had the mic between the neckband and the bud itself, on the left ear; which brought it at a very convenient place to take, decline calls, music controls and in general have better mic quality for the person on the other end. The Bass edition has the control/mic incorporated in the mic. It annoys me to bits when people on the other end complain about static noise being generated as a result of the mic rubbing on my shirt collar. And this also makes it virtually impossible to take the calls while on the bike. The original Z's mic could be tucked inside the visor of the helmet.It may seem like that I have crapped all over the headset, but it mainly owes to the fact that I had grown used to the original bullets wireless Z. It is still a decent buy. But only buy it if you're going to use it on a oneplus device. For other brands, I'd recommend look elsewhere."
"I was already having one earphone earlier a year ago  but due to some miss happening it got damaged.I ordered another but the quality is not up to the mark.During a voice call there is so much of disturbance in between, have to disconnect it and connect it again .Secondary the Bass version is so bad that the audio quality of any song or movie you play the sounds echoes and you can't even hear it clearly .Will Return It Very Soon ."
"I have purchased this two times, once a year ago from offline market at the same price, and second from the Amazon 1 month ago.After the unboxing i noticed, the box is little changed and premiumness is decreased if you have old version you can check it, one more wierd thing I wanna include, the cable of old version is 0.25inch bigger than this new one. Means seriously brand? (Cost cutting ki hadd hoti he)Let's come to the review now, yes after using this for small period, as always it's comfortable and long charging holder deivce ever, noise cancellation is awesome, cups you can change as per the given Options which allows to get an awesome comfort.One more thing, there are lots of features fixed in buttons but aren't mentioned in manual or website (again cost cutting)(1)press middle button once=video pause, play, call pickup & hang up a running call.(2)hold middle button=reject an incoming call & get Google Assistant support.(3)press middle button two times during music or video=forward.(4)press middle button 3 times during music or video=backward.(4)press vol up n down both=shut down."
"Definitely good for Mobile. Sound quality is good, You can hear podcasts using it without any problem. They are loud so 70% volume is good enough. but when i connected these to my mac, there is static heard in the first day itself. Not sure why it's not compatible with Mac. Mike quality is ok, but if you are planning to buy for office calls, better avoid this.  This is first two day review though."
"I purchased this product after seeing 4+ rating. However, its not that great.Also its not too bad either.I was expecting exceptional sound quality like we used to have in Sony some 10-15 years back.Sound is not very crisp. Even bass quality is just ok. Overall not outstanding experience.Plus point is that it's very comfortable to use and seamlessly connect.Price is more than the peer products, thats the reason I was expecting this one to be outstanding."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I am writing this review after 5-6 months of purchasing this item.. very bad static sound is coming during call. This problem is very prominent you can even check it on oneplus forum, people complaining about the same issue. You just won't be able to fix it in any way. Resetting or whatever you do it won't fix it. I mean why would you waste 2000 rupees if this is what you have to face in 5 months? And keypad also fell off after 3 months of use. Can't believe.. it was only good for first 4 months."
"I purchased it as its one plus brand, connectivity is good, calling is also nice, but if you are bass lover, you will be highly disappointed. Sometimes sound goes creepy as well. It looses the quality a bit. If there’s any return option I would like to return it.In the same price range you’ll get better neck bands."
"-I used ""Blaupunkt BE50 XL Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic"" - Its music is best in class but call clarity is not good because of high bass output in calls.-I used ""boAt Rockerz 330 Pro Wireless Neckband with 60HRS Playtime"" - Sorry to say, this is the worst earphone I have used in any category. Its music is very poor, all the music comes into the center and nothing to hear in a dolby surround level. Call clarity is also very poor. Only thing is, it has huge battery backup.-Finally I bought ""OnePlus Bullets Bluetooth Wireless Z Bass Edition in Ear Earphones with Mic (Black)"" -1. It has good Music, Nice bass, nice treble, good mid and vocal - You'll love it if you are a music lover.2. Call clarity is superb, either you are on phone or on zoom, crisp and clear.3. I used it continuously and its battery is superb with almost 17 Hrs of music play and calls.4. Charging time is 1 Hr 15 Mins.5. Easy to connect, light weight.No Negatives to say as of now..."
Bass (Low frequency) - 9/10Bass (Mid frequency) - 6/10Mids (Vocal/speech/instruments) - 7/10Highs - 6/10Sound Isolation - 6/10Build quality - 9/10Noise Isolation - 8/10Noise Cancellation - NA (Active Noise cancellation not present)Volume - 10/10 (12mm driver rocks!)Bluetooth Connectivity (Mobile/Laptop) - 9/10Bluetooth Range - 10/10 (~8m through multiple walls without any disturbance)Battery Backup - 4-5 HrsLow frequency bass is high and sometimes it shadows mid frequency bass. It could have been better if mids and highs are a little bit amplified. Set audio EQ carefully to get rid off it. Overall sound quality is good. Volume is too high because of 12mm driver which is helpful to hear audio/speech in noisy places.Connectivity is crazy! I am using it for long calls (Both mobile and Laptop) and never faced any issue with connectivity and range.
I purchased this for my poco X2 phone and the first was not connecting with my phone and if connects then disconnect automatically and will not connect again for hours then after restarting multiple times it will connect again so I went for replacement. I got replacement and there was no connectivity issue but when I am on call there is always some static background noise and it was so bad and loud that I had to return the product.
"Recently I had to retire my Jabra elite 25e after 3 years of usage, before that I used Samsung level u for 2 years. After a lot of research, I have ordered Blue Parrott M300XT which is a big disappointment for INR4300/- (Not from Amazon)No battery backup (2.5 hrs against claimed 14 hrs), faulty model, ear pain, heating issues, low volume.My gamble to try a new model has failed and instantly I had to look for a reliable neckband under INR 2000/- as I have already burnt my hands. Oh boy! Oneplus has not disappointed.Pros:-1. Instant pairing attach and detach2. Good environmental noise cancellation even at 60% volume3. Quick charging4. good range (This something very tough to comment)5. Detach to answer the call feature is great6. Comfortable earplugs (Jabra Elite25e and Samsung levelu I had ear fatigue)7.  Lightweight and adequate wire length.Cons:-1. Should have included a mute button (only jabra elite models have it)Verdict:- If you are looking for a no-fuss comfortable reliable neck band go for it.Oppo M31 has less battery and Real Me buds earplugs are big, Level U is bulky.So ONEPLUS BULLETS WIRELESS BASS Edition is an allrounder for INR 2000/-Don't expect a noise-cancelling mic like Poly Voyager 5200 it's made for different use case."
"It works fine for music but whenever you want to make a call there is a cracking sound coming from it. I replaced one but the next one is also showing the same problem, they have managed to produce a damaged product , it's their in built fault and they are not going to fix it until and unless someone filled a complaint at consumer court and make them pay for their dishonest business.."
"Sound, Bass and Noise Cancellation are excellent but the battery backup is not as mentioned in the production description so it's a wastage of money as it doesn't meet the expectations. I suggest all not to buy this product with the price of ₹1999. I also returned this after finishing the battery backup issue.This product worth only ₹700 not more. Microphone is also not working, sometimes it stops working in between."
"""Bass boosted"" is upto its name.Absolutely fantastic sound quality, noise cancellation etc, especially with a oneplus phone the compatibility is just amazing!With non OnePlus phones, experience might not be the best, all cool features don't work as well."
"Sound Quality: GoodConnectivity: not up to mark, looks like it's not Bluetooth V5Working great with OnePlus 6, qual quality too bad with poco F1Music quality good with all devices I useBattery n charging: GreatI'd go for Infinity 120 for connectivity ( I can connect two phones at the same time)For battery: OnePlus hands downNote: I've used both, I enjoyed infinity more for half the priceI had requested for replacement of my copy, Amazon didn't process my requestSad times"
"Nice sound amazing productSo coming from a quality wired earphones to this neck band (RIP headphone jack) this wireless band cant bridge that gap.PROS-Awesome battery life,Great quick switch functionality (not available in BASE EDITION, great job one plus marketing team),Quality phone calls (get it immediately of u spend long time in meetings or calls) WFH Fever,Type C and fast charge (minor but still its there)Even the band to ear bud wire length is different.. had difficulty in position with my shirt collar. BASE EDITION legth is not enought. Stupid company. Had to return Bass Edition due to removal of quick switch and reduced ear cord length.CONS--Music will become less enjoyable so buyer beware,BASE EDITION-Music does feel good but one plus cleverly REMOVED the QUICK SWITCH and even positioned the MICROPHONE on the neck band directly while in NORMAL EDITION it used to be on the control island thingy with volume.Any physical changes must be highlighted. Guess one plus no longer enthusiast brand."
"It is the best under 2000 for calls, music and gaming but if you compare it with high end earbuds like Sony XB-WF700 then those will blow this out of water in sound quality and rich bass. In these bass is high sound quality is ok but in high end earbuds it's not crystal clear. Don't think that these sound crappy no no these sound good and for 2000 these are the best value for money."
"Pros: Lightweight & Fast-chargingCons: Sound clarity, Bass, Microphone placement, Battery Backup& Build Quality.P.S. Earlier  non-bass edition was very good. This version is bad. I don’t recommend."
"No doubt other headphones are much cheaper than this with the same features but while using this no one will regret his/her decision of choosing it. Amazing built quality, premium look, soothing audio and everything is good except battery life for those who have used boat headphones will feel battery life poorer in comparison but its ok for daily use once in a day needs charging and provide whole day battery backup."

 I had bought these earphones around 10 months back, one side of it stopped working so I claimed it's waranty and was provided a new pair in March 2022. While I was on a call today, it automatically got disconnected from call and started giving a static/hissing sound. It isn't getting switched off, neither does hard reset work. Charging the set doesn't work. At this point I literally feel like crushing this with a brick?!! Such poor quality product.Have been a die hard fan of OnePlus but you've lost me in recent times.One plus sucks!!?!!"
"There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues. It is known issue with the buds, and you need to reset the device to get it back, and then again the crackling starts2nd time am purchasing the same but very very disappointed. Previous model itself having quick switch option, but this model not having.It's mentioned in the features that bass edition have quick switch option, but their is no quick Switch Button. Don't know why they have mentioned it in the features. I guess they have just copy paste features from their older edition to bass edition."
"I was order this product as birthday gift to my wife. I was order this 13 days before my wife's birthday. I received it within 3 days. After I keep it as it is in a safe place without  open this. On birthday I present it to wife. She is happy but after 1 day. She complaint me this product is faulty after That I tryed to return but Amazon's 10 day return policy is over so I contact to OnePlus service center. Service said to me first they test to this product for 3 days and then they deside to replace or not. I have no choice but want to say to OnePlus service center, ""this is a very bad customer service.""  Also in future I never buy OnePlus's any product. Good bye OnePlus."
"Have been using the first handsfree for continuous 2 years which still looks like new product to me... Would have continued using same if my brother wouldn't have stepped on it... The current model has been changed and looks too delicate too, the wire might get cuts soon also have re-ordered the product as the replacement was cancelled but still facing the battery issue with the product.."
"I have received a product with very good packing. As usual one plus box is beautifully designed for its customers. Here are some pros and consPros:- Premium Packaging- Bass and Trible quality is awesome- Elegant design- Stylish look- Quality is awesome wrt price- Quick pairing esp when you are using oneplus device- Supports Type C charger and quick chargingCons:- Should improve the wire quality of Right and left earphones- Should have provided the carrying pouchI really love this amazing product ! Can't expect oneplus would provide quality product with awesome sound quality at this price. Previously I have used Bose Soundsport, Galaxy buds+ Jabra 65T and out of all Bose Soundsport is one of the best headphones and Oneplus is now in that vision."
"Writing this review after using it for 15 days. I am using it by paired with iPhone7 and believe me it is one of the best neck band, I have found.iPhone7 has Bluetooth version 4.0 and in some reviews I read it is compatible with Bluetooth 5.0 and latest versions. But, I haven't yet faced any single issue related to connectivity or latency in voice.Hats off to its battery life. In 15 days I have charged it for twice only.I was very confused before buying it due to review I found here, but believe me and buy it without any second thought."
"I earlier had the normal Z and bullets 2. But this one seems to me worth a deal. For its price the sound and battery is very good. I don't think bass lovers would be happy with this bass. But clarity is good. Sound seperation and sterio imaging is also simple if that's gets you well. I hope it had the button for multipoint, that's the biggest bummer from these though not a huge one but still bothers when u need to switch in between. So if you just want a decent sounding earphones and just want to carry it during work, workout or anything for casuals it will be a good deal. But if you're looking for audio quality wise, then it's not the best specially in this price range what else can u hope, with AAC codec only."

"After receiving the earphone today, 1st impression of sound quality was bad as i was there was crackling sound when listening to YouTube video songs in Mackbook Pro. But when tried in Pixel phone, it was all clear. Tried in 2 other devices and audio was clear without any crackling noise. So it got clear that earphones are good, problem is in bluetooth in Macbook Pro which after reading some online resolution, got fixed (deleted bluetooth related .plist file from Library -> Preference folder and restarted the Mac). So now i am enjoying these lovely earphones. So far so good.Build quality is good. These are so light weight that one won't even notice that its around neck when worn for longer time. Switching devices is smooth even without dedicated switch button. Call quality is also Ok. Battery life not tested yet but fast charging really works. Wish they provided a longer USB-C cable, its very tiny."
"So, I replaced my original bullet wireless bass edition when I noticed this issue and to my surprise the new replacement had the same issue. I, then, replaced this second earphone too and the third one had the same problem again. OnePlus sent me new earphones in a sealed pack every time so I'm sure it was not the same piece.With this third piece I tried all the troubleshooting possible. From resetting the network setting to resetting my one plus 7 but nothing worked. This earphone was working all fine with other phones. I tried this with my friends Oneplus 7, hoping that it would not work, but it was working fine with his phone. Even other bluetooth earphones like Sony WI-C200, boat rockerz 335 etc are working fine with my phoneThe only possible answer is that only few devices has this wireless connectivity issue with bullets bass edition version. I cannot think of anything else.TL;DR There is no solution for this issue.Workaround I've purchased the one plus bullets normal version ( not the bass edition) and this earphone works flawlessly with my phone. tbh, the normal version is better than the bass edition becuase of the handy quick switch button and for the bass, its almost the same.I'd suggest all of you to get the normal version (not the bass edition) or any other bluetooth earphone you like."
Pros1. Great sound effects2. Bass is great3. Bluetooth range is awesome4. Charging in 10 - 20mins lasts for 45hrsCons1. Didn't know that the device will not work when both the earpieces are attatched together(must mention that somewhere in the box)2. Did not come as a complementary with my Oneplus 8T device
"Please don't buy this. This earphones mic doesn't work at all. I bought two and noticed it after a few weeks, sadly otherwise I would have returned it right away. I googled and found out that so many users are facing the same issue. Its like the microphone doesn't EXIST and that's not all there are these random popping/cracking noise while listening to music etc. Please don't buy this."
Magnet of both ear buds joints Bluetooth connection gets off means disconnects from device and when you separate it reconnect to the device but it takes some time and after using 5 days now its not reconnecting. I have to go to Bluetooth section and connect it again and again. I have factory reset it but same thing happening. When i have call i put buds in my ear and wait till its connect with my phone then i need receive call from phone of switch given on handsfree. It would be better if magnetic call receive/cut system developed instead of magnetic power on/off system because magnetic power on/off system takes time to reconnect and we have to go for receive call. Device switch system is too pathetic every time you need to go for connect. sound quality is really good.
"Review after 20 days of useWell satisfied with the productBought for 1999/-*Good battery backup (I get 13-15 hours)*Better sound quality*Fully charged by 40 mins approx (I couldn't find when it's getting 100% charged by any indicators, I'm finding it after connected to the phone)*Noise cancelation is good*Very light weight"
"I am using this product for quite a few months now and here are some points I’d like to mention:Connectivity : Really good 👍 4/5 (no switch option avlb!)Comfy level: Very light 🍃 5/5Sound quality: Mids(3/5) | Highs(2/5) | Bass(1.5/5 - Extra bass my ass 😂)Battery: 3.5/5 Will easily last 5-6hr on heavy use.Overall experience: 2.5/5✅ Good for regular use if  sound/mic quality is not your concern.⚠️ Not recommended for audiophiles!⛔️ MAJOR CON 🥲: The product is defective, one may hear crackling sound from time to time specially while changing volume.Had returned the product and the new one was no different.Solution(Weird / Temporary):1> Change volume repeatedly  until sound input is totally gone 😂 and then simply forget the device and re-pair. This may  work for a few hrs.2> Get use to it 😂"
I expected better sound quality for such a price point. The build quality is good but sound did not do for me. The bass overshadowed the rest of the music due to which the sound seemed a bit muffled.Still I would recommend for the casual music listener but not to someone whose priority is sound quality and music detailing.
"First of all ,A big thanks to Amazon for delivering this product in my village, seriously speaking I didn't expect this fast delivery in village so I am impressed 5star for delivery service also.Now about the product it's an excellent product with superb noise cancellation specs this makes it good for traveling purpose . Also the charging is c pin USB ,so you don't need to carry extra usb for it. As for sound , quality is excellent ,for almost every type of beat it sound pretty good. Overall it's worth buying at this price . You say na in Hindi ""Paisa vasool""."
"Sound Quality - 3/5Bass - 3/5Battery life - 5/5Charging speed - 5/5Call quality - 5/5Comfortable - 4/5Overall : 3/5 Not as expected 😥(Can't Return it, if it'd be possible would buy Boat 255 pro plus, But😭)Overall Okay okay, product. Not Really liked as, it is overpromoted by reviews and youtubers 🤮.[Have already boat 900 wired 😘😍 which is one of the best in the market and comparing OnePlus z bass edition to boat 900 is like - Boat 900 😍 is thousands time better in sound quality than OnePlus Z bass edition👎]Conclusion : Not worth two thousand rupees. It sounds like Boults ( 250rs )basic wired earphones😒Advice for the new buyer : if you want to listen to music (like feel) and going to watch movies or series with these, don't buy this.❌"
"Review after 2 months of use:1. Battary back up is good.2. Charging speed and feasibility to charge are good. 10-15 min charge can sustain your day.3. Connectivity with paired device is good, pairing is fast.4. Switching between 2 devices could have been better and fast.5. Call quality (Specially the noise cancelation) is worst and of very poor quality. It won't cancel any noise and any environmental noise and background voice will always be very loud and hearable at the other end of call.If calling is not the purpose then it will be very good choice to buy."
"After purchase 2 months it was smooth but compare to my previous or working Bluetooth (boat) it's sound quality is not good as that brand , so after 2nd month right side sound started decreasing a week later that side stop working so I thought I should exchange but that's was even worst because the service center service is so slow n unorganized that  while waiting for ur turn to just handover or for checking u have plenty time to decide wheather to leave and buy new product rather wasting time or just wait for hrs for their confirmation if genuinely product is working or not then after all of that they ask to wait for wait another 1-2hrs to provide u exchange.So after wasting my Sunday in service center I finally received my exchanged earphone n that disappointed me so well that I came back to my ex earphonesLong review but short msg not worth it is just a hyped product"
"Sound signature is goodBalanced bass and good sound clarity2 day battery backup(4-5 hours of usage per day)Call quality is good but the environment noise is not reduced, even it picks up noise from 10ft away.There are sometime the headphone is not connecting to iPhone automatically but connects to laptop automatically."
"Earphone doesnt vibrate when there is a call which means i have to wear it in my ear all the time. Its such an inconvenience. The whole point of using a neck band is tht i can wear it only when i want to attend  a call or music.The magnet on the earphone is a bad bad idea.  If earphones are stuck magnetically,  tht means it is off. How can it alert me. It remains connected only if both earphones are away. Not practical at all. Cant return it either. Am stuck."
"Good sound quality and nice build quality.I really hoped it has button to switch between multiple devices which was there in normal edition which was discontinued.It's a bit annoying to manually disconnect from one device and connect from another again and again.Also, little bit sound leakage problem is there when used on high volume."
Product works fine. But there is some technical prob. In description they mentioned like we can pair with multiple devices and we can switch among them.  But that won't happen. We have to do that manually from ur connected device. And it won't switch. It get disconnect from the paired device then it will connect with another device.
Very handy easy to use on the go and very interesting point is it is charged for 10 minutes and you can use it for the whole day. good for listening to music without disturbing others at a very high quality and attending calls on the go or attending meeting this is very useful. Overall awesome experience. Attending phone while charging is very easy and safe with this device
"1. It's really very light weight neckband, even you forget after few times that you have it on your neck.2. Balanced Sound quality and bass quality superb.3. Its build up quality superb.4. Noise cancellation really works superb in this neck band.5. Battery backup is also superb.Overall after 5 days experience I am completely satisfied and happy with this neckband.Thanks to One+ for the innovation of this Z bass edition."
Gifted to my son for online classes and he immediately fell in love with it after using two three different headphones earlier. It makes him independent  to move to pick up a book or take a glass of water without taking off  this bluetooth earphone while class is on. Sound quality is excellent as compared to other brands and worth the money. Used it for Two months now. Happy fir this purchase. Will buy one for self also
After going through several of wireless earphones finally chose this one..the quality is good.. comfortable on ears ....noise cancellation is good... Can't hear anything outside.... The packaging was also good got a fully sealed box which is good....also the quality of the neckband is also good... overall totally a value for money. Would totally recommend it over sony and boat!
"Mic not work properly during callNoise cancellation very weakNot getting good sound outcome as relted to price comparisionBass also normal soft nd feel bass not come only simple hard one, treble ratio also not match properly relate to bass to enjoy musicDont go for it select any other"
"The brand name and heavy ratings made me purchase this for 2000₹. But, I feel like they've merged the ratings of previous model which has the swap button for switching between devices. Unfortunately the present model doesn't have that facility. And when talk to anyone using the headset, they can hear every unwanted sounds other than our voice, that is quite annoying. And for continuous use, I'm not getting a back up of 17hrs as they demand. The thing only I like in this is its sound quality. So guys, do think twice before your purchase rather than falling behind the heavy ratings and brand name."

 There are serious crackling issues with iPhone in these earphones, I tested it with 3 iOs devices and with my android tv also.I even exchanged it because I thought my product was faulty.But I finally had to return it.It only works well with android phones, not even android tv or older laptops.if you use iPhone, skip this product, it is not for you.Being in the 2000 INR price range that too with bass, I think that the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z ’s built quality, look and overall sound quality is really nice. The Bullets Wireless Z also fits really well in the ears. The IP55 water and sweat resistance is also a good addition.Call quality is also really nice, and pairing is fast too.If you want lower latency for gaming or some ANC, I suggest you go for Realme Wireless 2 neckband instead of this, they have better sound.The only better thing oneplus has over realme is that the call quality in realme is a little robotic, but it’s not a dealbreaker because realme also has ANC and gaming mode to reduce latency. It’s for 2299.But then again, I would really suggest to go for Realme Buds Air 2 and go wireless instead of neckbands. It’s much more convenient and they are amazing earbuds.I bought all the best earbuds and neckbands and finally found these at 3200, Realme Buds Air 2 provided me with the best experience. Nothing else came close.it was an overall great product, and this is coming from an iPhone user, so if you use iPhone or android (or even android tv or an old laptop) and you are reading this is in August-December 2021, go for Realme Buds Air 2, it’s the best product currently available."
"I am writing this review after using this product for 2 months.This product has nice sound quality and noise cancellation.But sometimes when i Connect to Laptop, it just shows connected to bluetooth but i cant hear other person while on call. Sound comes from system instead of bluetooth earphone. So i totally remove the device and add it again. It gets automatically disconnect and connect back.While i connect to zoom call on phone, if i disconnect the bluetooth by mistake and if i connect back, I can hear others but others cant hear my voice."
"Ordered these 2 years back and never regretted this buy!!I reffered this product to many of my friends.Everything was perfect till date.The build quality was extraordinary, super good base and everything was upto the mark.One of side stopped working after two years  , without giving a second thought ordered the same but now in black colour and guess what??...The build quality is compromised now . The wires are thin, the collar material is of low quality but there is no change in sound quality.Two years back it was a worth buy for 2k, but now it is not."
"Hi AllWriting after 1 month usePros-1- Great Design, Faster connectivity2- Fast charging3- Amazing sound quality and call clarity4- Comfortable to use and no fear of losing it as it will be around your neck always 🙂Cons/Improvements1- Some more work can be done around Noise cancellationOne plus smartphone users can anytiy go for it. Other brands also works fine with this."
Its stop functioning after 2 months of use that to again very infrequent usage. On top of that one plus service center in Pune not allowing more than 50 cases per day. I noticed a long queue outside of oneplus service center. This itself indicates poor product quality check for one plus.Sound quality is fine.
"I bought these earphones after using one plus bullets z for almost 2 years. I initially had high expectations for it but it disappointed in every case.1. The sound quality is good but not that great.2. There is some noticable glitch or cracking sound whenever I use it with my laptop to attend teams call. I have to disconnect and re connect everytime it happens. It will temporarily solve the issue but re appears after some time.3. I can say the battery quality is fine but my previous one earphones are better compared to these.4. One more thing, the earphones suddenly disconnected and connected while using them.It is just 2nd day of using them and don't know how these will work in long run."

 Worst quality product do not ever buy one plus BluetoothProduct quality is very cheap and only last a monthWorst product ever"
"Not working after few weeks time. Called customer care for warranty replacement, but they are telling i need to go to the service centre which is around 70 kms from my home. Basically i need to go there 2 times one for repair and next time to collect it back, which will cost more than the price of the item and my two days effort. Please don't buy this item. They have very few service centres and no door step sercice at all.."
"Best part of this product is , it gets charged upto 90% in really 10 min as they mentioned in product description which makes it very useful in case of low battery and you don't need to wait till hours to get it charged up again.And it is very flexible at neck side so there are very less possibilities to get it damaged because of rough use.Overall, Value for Money and go for such product which gives you such quality and durability"
one side of my neckband stopped working after 6 month of usage .. to be honest i never write a review for any product but ... this is really impressive ... i went to one plus experience store  they took my old neck band and they just gave me a brand new box of the same neckband .. 🖤🖤🖤🖤
"At this price bracket these are the finest earbuds. No doubt,this product is value for money as well as best quality and no other earbuds can compete wid oneplus till 6-7k price range.Trust me blindly and Buy it without any second thought u will never  regret."
"Pros.-1. build quality bahut hi achi h is prize me,light  weightt h good job.  2.fast charge very good.  3. Bluetooth pairing working very well.Cons.-1.after 5days use is headphone ka battery drain  40% bad gya h.  2.sound quality avarage hai.  3. Smart switching hona chahiye tha jada better  hota.Finale verdict- in this prize this product is avarage/good."
"Pros: Very low latency, so it's a good one for gaming like Pubg Cod etc. Very quick charge, you can charge it for 10 min and still use it for the rest of the day or sometimes even more. For those who love to listen to music with boosted up bass, this earphone is perfect for you.Cons:  There are no cons for me as of now ,but I want to mention that if you don't like extra bass , then you might give it a second thought.Rest , it's one of the best I have used till now.Call Quality is great and also provides a good connection from a few distance.I ordered the black but received the blue, but it's fine . I am happy with my purchase"
"In just around 8 months, one side of the earphone stopped working for me and don't know how to claim warranty. Really disappointed with the quality of neckband, will not suggest anyone to buy. In my family two bought and same problem with both of the neckband and duration is same around 6-8 months"
"The mic on this phone is one of the worst I’ve seen on a Bluetooth headphone. Though the quality of the voice is adequate however it is probably the worst choice for a phone call or an online meeting. The mic, instead of cancelling noise and focusing on the users voice, cancels the users voice and focuses on the noise. It’s a horrible experience for the listener on any call. OnePlus should focus on fixing this. It seems to be more of a software issue than hardware issue because otherwise the mic picks up the voice pretty clearly in a completely noise free environment (I mean not even fan noise because it attracts fan noise like anything)."
I have purchased the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition (Bold Black) ( B092ZJVB6Z ) HSN:85176290 from Amazon App on 08 Aug 21. It is also inform you that One Plus wireless earphone which I have purchased is in poor quality condition. It creating some disturbed noises while we talking with someone which the other person can't hear properly. It puts me in trouble and embarrassment situations with in a week after purchasing the same and I feel very bad being an OnePlus owner. I cannot accept this from OnePlus brand. My friends were using the same brand they are also complaining about the extra noises issue. I don't know what happened to this brand new wireless earphone. I had OnePlus wireless Z before but that impressed me well due to mis usage the wire got broken. The other audio quality features is amazing and the only problem occurs during calls. Without any calls there is no use of having the wireless earphone.
"I am writing my review after using 2 product (1) 6 months usage new product. 2). 6 months usage of replacement this item. No value for money.Low quality of the neck band, it always folded. Less distance Bluetooth coverage.No caller voice quality.No much audio quality difference between oneplus and other local product.Don't buy it.  I won't like this product"
I am using 1+ phone so I prefered this earphone from the same manufacturer thinking of compatibility. 1+ has proved itself as a quality product however as a surprise to me the right side earphone stopped working just after 3 months of use. I have used much affordable bluetooth earphones previously and they lasted minimum a year. I didn't expect such quality from 1+ products.
"Writing review after 2 months of use, it's a better bluetooth device from what is available in market.Pros1. Good sound quality2. Best battery backup3. Rough & toughCons1. The neckband is very slmy & soft - needs to be bit hard2. If you use with single piece in your ear ( lot of distortion )3. Very high possibility that your microphone may become faulty - happy that after 15 days use it went 👎 , but spent two rounds to one plus showroom to get it repaired.Its a good buy, but I bet it's certainly not the best in market"
Used for one week. Here is my feedbackSound quality: Don't expect bass more from this headset. Vocals highlighted more.Noise cancellation: For calls i don't have any issue. Attended multiple conference calls. Opposite person able to here my voice properly in force wind & in crowd.Charging: After charging 10mins i can able to use for 4 to 5minProblems:When you press vol +/- then able to hear some noise in the headset.

 Overall Value for Money, best feature is automatically disconnect from mobile when both left and right earpiece connected together magnetically.Battery Backup - Very GoodFast Charge-  AvailableComfort- Nice 👍Sound Quality - Good ( Bass on higher side ) Higher node could be better ....but no complaints because of the price.Build Quality- Very GoodEarlier I was using OnePlus Bullet 2, got damaged after using 2 Years on regular uses....In this one I am missing quick connect (dedicated) button.Just go for it ..."
"I had purchased this OnePlus Bullets Bluetooth Wireless Z Bass Edition in Ear Earphones with Mic (Black) on 28th November, 2021 and I started using this a couple of days ago.  The battery is not getting charged at all.Only when I plugged in the redlight glows.  If I remove from the charging unit it does not powering ON.  I am not able to use this instrument at all.  It is a total waste of money. I would like to have the replacement for this at the earliest."
"It is really worthless to buy such a costly product, full waste of money.I am facing lots of issues with the product like connectivity issue ( automatically get disconnect and reconnect after few seconds), noisy background sound while calling ( receiver & caller both the side), slow sound quality.Neither OnePlus nor amazon is helping me to get resolve the issue.As the return window is already closed, so i am unable to place return order of the product, i approached OnePlus customer care service center also but after getting it repair I am still facing the same issues.Highly disappointed with the OnePlus product and amazon services.Even after writing number of mails to OnePlus, I didn't get the right solution at all. I requested for the replacement or return of the product but found unresponsive & helpless all the time. I would like to suggest everyone not to buy this product, there are varities of product in this price range, so go for that instead of OnePlus."
"This is really good product for music .. have really good battery backup.. PROBLEM starts only after 5-6 months of usage .. connectivity issues starts around 5th month ,it will turn on&off automatically.. then it will stop working.. it will charge but will not start and connect to any device...I have bought one on January 2021 and faded by may 2021.. and i bought again in june 2021 which lasted only for December which is y am writing this review.. Extremely disappointed.. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LONG TIME USAGE"
"Unfortunately I was supplied defective pieces in the original supply & the replacement & therefore cannot comment. I believe the brand is good but the supplier didn't have good intentions. I was perhaps supplied returns, leftover defective pieces. Just imagine that too from Appario Retail."
"Everything is good with headset but the call answering feature should might be given in headset but it is not there and battery backup is very poor, after whole night charging also it is showing zero percent in morning when We try to use headset that is really upset thing in one plus bullets, it should be sorted"
This Earphones is completely a downgrade from the previous version.No Quick Switch Button. That button was very very very useful.Also one more major issue with this Earphones are cracking sound which usually comes when we are on call.
"Built quality seems to be good  material feels premium. You can get nice clearity, good for calls, video calls online classes and stuffs like that.But if you are a bass lover and you cant compromise with bass and you can spend little more than this, dont go for these earphones. I have been using wired earphones till now and my sony wired earphones with half of this price gives me great bass, balanced sound.So, if thats your case too, than these pairs may disappoint you otherwise they are good.Conclusion: not bad.  3.5/5"
"No doubt the sound is amazing.. The earphones fit perfectly but the problem is that it is not good for mobile phones. I ordered it for laptop and when i first used it in my redmi note 8 the other person's voice was breaking a lot because my intenet was on. I close my internet and voice comes clear.. Also when i am on a video call these eaphone are a waste. The video breaks for no reason. As soon as I remove the earphone the video is all ok.. I don't know why this is not fixed yet as i already saw some same reviews . But this only of you listen songs, or for laptop.. Do not buy it if you are using it for video calls on cell phone. It does not work"
"This product only good for oneplus mobile users because for other brand mobiles is connect it makes crackling or poping noise its really horrible. Oneplus  need to improve for other brand mobile users ,first time i buy this product crackling sound in right ear peice I think its manufacture problem then i replace it but again same problem is occur i am really disappointEd with oneplus brand..they consider only one plus mobile user...😐"
"*Bought for ₹2000/-*Using on my Device One Plus 8T.1. Sound Quality is Good, also I have MI neckband Pro (₹1700), compared to it MI has Active Noise cancellation and ENC but for ₹2000/- one plus doesn't offer even ENC.2. Plus point is that Pairing Device became quite easy than earlier one. But Switching between devices has been removed.3. Battery backup is below average.....4. Time consuming charging... Even MI neckband pro (₹1700/-) charges faster and lasts for 4 days other hand one plus for hardly 2 days."
"The item i received was working for 2-3 hrs and later the notification LED itslf was not blinking but when trying to charge, it was glowing. Anyway later the product was not functioning even i press and hold the power button for more than 20 seconds.While it was working, the following points are what I felt..Initially I was using Sennheiser CX 275s and the base & treble was equally very good.. the sound quality was pretty good and whenever needed the base was there.But in this earphones i felt like the base was more dominant regardless of what ever type of instrument used in the song..I felt the same with BOAT Rockers 255F also.."
"Some basic points you should know before purchasing this eaephone :-*Sound Quality :- the sound quality is very good, you can listen every instrumental music and different types of music without any disturbance in noise.*Bass:- when you listen any song with high bass or low bass, you gonna feel it. You can enjoy high quality bass boosted song with this eaephone (almost like you are in other world)*Calling:- the person on the call will hear your very clear voice without any disturbance. But if there is someone talking near to you then there is little bit background noise problem (negligible).* Battery Charging :- As i have 5Watt adopter, it takes almost 1.5 hour to full charge.*battery Backup :- once it is  full charged, It takes more than 15 hours to discharge. You can use it non stop for 1 whole day.I wrote down almost everything i experienced after using this earphone.It is one of the best wireless earphones in this price segment."
"Excessive voice distortion during call. I have been using one plus z and this one plus z base edition both but this is pathetic. Got it replaced from one plus store but still same voice distortion during call. Its a manufacturing defect with most of this base edition. Go to a one plus sevice centre n youll find many replacement cases with same problem. My friend also reported same l, got it replaced but still same problem.Strongly not recommended."
"I have used several earphones that are bass heavy, and by far these are the worst bass of them all. and if u ever plan to use them with MacBook pro DONNOT buy these. there is a crackling sound and has been reported by several people in one plus forum. u can search that on google.  better go for sony earphones."
"The headphone is not that great. I expected a lot from Oneplus. The charge doesn't drain too fast which is a positive thing.  The noise cancellation is poor. The sound quality is average, it sounds pretty cheap actually. I personally find the magnetic thingy (where the headphones pause once the buds stick together coz they are magnetized) about the ear buds pretty annoying. Others might love it. As a casual user who only uses headphones when necessary, like crowded places or meetings, I am a little let down but I can cope. I just hope it lasts long."
Although the sound and bass is good - there is one MAJOR PROBLEM the headphone gets disconnected frequently (I'm using OnePlus Nord) and it's very irritating that every 5-10mins I need to reconnect headphone and my phone inbetween my calls or when I'm watching a movie. And now even exchange window has closed to add to my issue. My suggestion Don't Buy This Product
"I wanted headphone for office calls, I tried multiple headphones but their mic quality was not up to the mark and I had to return themI was getting confused with some of the negative reviews for this headphone but finally bought this!I am extremely happy and I am enjoying it so much! I will surely recommend this, build quality, sound quality, mic quality, battery life everything is awesome!"
"Everything's great... Sound, the ease of using, Comfortable except the charging time and running time. Advertisement said that it gets charged in 10 mins which is not true. It takes approx an hour to fully charged it. Secondly regarding running time it, after full charge it hardly works for 6-8 hours with full usage whereas its supposed work for 12-14 hours minimum."
"Review after two month use...The sound on this buds is good if you just want to enjoy music doing outdoor activities. Don't expect instrument seperation, or clarity in mid & lows. It just gets the job done, ie. Fits perfectly in ears (in my experience), and generates decent audio for the price. battery lasts around 2-3 days in moderate use. Didn't had any problem in attending calls, the microphone is also good.Read some reviews that the earphones make some crackling sound, i also faced the same issue, but got resolved after disconnecting and reconnecting it."
"After 3 months.. the neckaband's right bud had volume issue. The volume level was too low in the right ones and not equally balanced with left ones. Resetting the device multiple times didn't help. I took the product to authorised service desk and they replaced for a new one.Note : There's no repair for this product and in the first one year after purchase, if you got any issues they'll replace your product."
"Believe me, I have tried a lot of Wireless gaming headsets and this one stands best for playing Pubg. The latency is very very low and you can merely ignore it. Now I am very happy to play freely with four fingers used. Every Pubg player needs it."
"Every basic things it lacks... Let me clear my statement. First i had sony earphone which during call has separate volume for both call and media(videos, music if u r playing still on call), but here in one plus which was my first ever Bluetooth earphone made me so disappointed and also at my choice i made lacks this feature,if u r on call and play videos or music it has only one volume bar which has not same volume of call and media... U raise the volume to hear the music call volume get high unbearably...AND when i play video while on call Nooo sound,nothing inaudible and video play in such slow motion which is not at all Normal........... I bought today and thew it alway far today itself..... Don't buy..!!!"
"I had boat wireless earphones earlier and that was nightmare experience for me as i work in an administrative dept in a bank and have to make hundreds of calls everyday, the boat earphones didn't have noise cancellation and the battery life was like i had to charge it everyday but THIS IS A REAL FIND for me.I charge it completely and use it for a week without any worries, sound quality is decent and noise cancellation is Amazing.I dont have any complaints after a use of almost 2 months.A sure shot buy call from me."
"Neck band is too short and weight less comparing with the old one. It will goes on real air when I ride my bike 😂. In side my helmet old Mike is placed inside my helmet. But with the new one I need to speak louder to answer my phone calls 🙄. Bass boosted edition is a cheating logo to sell the product with the same price, because same sound quality. Not a improved one. Even bass too.Same packing.Same sound.Nothing improved.Comparing with old one Three star rating is more than enough."
Pro's1. The sound quality is good enough at this price point.2. Stylish neckband with black color.3. Decent battery backup.Con's1. Multiple device connectivity2. Some laptop isn't supported3. Quick switch is only between oneplus devices4. Latest bluetooth version5. High Quality Codec Missing(LDAC)Reason for not suitable for me :1.Multiple Device Connectivity2. Music Quality3.

"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Need to some improvements in battery backup and charging also too slow sound quality is normal but much better then Boat . If you want tension free life then go with one plus"
"Brought this for MS teams calls and worked like charm for a 4 months and right in the 5th month stopped working in one ear.Just because I had removed the mesh to clear the wax deposition, the service centre refused to replace the product. If One plus cant trust the consumer, then many more users like me wont go for One plus!"
"I am impressed with the sound quality. However if you ask my experience while I wear this during my exercise session, I won’t suggest this. Instead go for headphones or something else. They would drop out of my ears and I have to adjust them every 15secs. While stationary, they are sturdy but if you are buying it for gym, don't buy it."
"Extremely Dispointed..!!!I have order this OnePlus Z bass addition but it does not coonect to my Android ( RedMi Note 9 Pro Max). I have disturburance, cracking the voice, not audioble from my side.Even i replaced Oneplus Wireless with new one under warrenty but still the new replced earphones also having the same problem of voice disturbance, craking soumd on every call.Even i'm having the Oneplus wireless new Z Bass addition earphones i need too take it off to atten the call."
It's important to understand that each wireless headphones how so ever high price has a shelf life. So it's important you choose the best output based and use them. In this case it meets all requirements in terms of sound quality.
"I am using bullet neck band since 2years. I don't know why, but there is a definite problem arises within 5 months and you have to go to service centre for replacement. I have purchase this 2 times in last 20 months. And run for replacement 3 times. In other words have used total 5 earphones in this period. This earphone has a very short life. After one year warranty you to make a another purchase worth ₹2000 for this neck band."
"Nowadays..some decision makers in Amazon are doing wrong things to defeat Amazon growth in India. All products are selling with defects and not functioning. If Amazon head will not taking action against those Black sheeps, then Amazon will lose their name and fame. This is my fifth time feeling pathetic for purchasing from Amazon"
"If you, like me, take a lot of work calls- this headphone won’t disappoint you. Sure the sound quality is average, but what it lacks in sound, it makes up in affordability, battery life, call quality, and build quality."
"It works good if on normal calls or listening to songs or watching movies. But, Its absolutely not compatible with zoom calls. You need an external application loaded, to get it connected with zoom calls. Even then it has noise glitches and blackouts every now and then."
"Loved the way it connects in a snap to my OnePlus phone. Yet, it disconnects often in between calls and have to be switched off and on to reconnect. Though it shows to be connected, voice and mic is disconnected. This happens on playing music too. Maybe some software glitch."
bad ONE PLUS HAS DEGRADED THEIR PRODUCT IN SUCH A BAD AND DIASASTEROUS MANNERdual compatibility not there no quick switchVOICE CLARITY POOR AND COMPLEX ISSUESDO NOT GO FOR THIS ANY OTHER COMPANIES ARE  FAR FAR BETTER
"I got this earphone for 1799/- as It had really great impressions. The sound quality, bass etc were great but there is a constant crackling sound which ruins the experience. First, I thought it might be manufacturing defect so I exchanged for another unit. The second one also had the same issue. I looked it up and found that this edition of headset has the issue for almost everyone except users with OnePlus phones. It seems to be compatible with OnePlus phones only. So I had no other option that to ask for refund."
"Previously I used many such products, but there were many problems, if bass was good, then phone calls were not at all good. But this product, bass, noise canceling, phone call voice, everything is just too good"
"My device is Poco F1 and when I connected the neckband with my device, while making phone calls there are so many disturbance and echoes through the Bluetooth neckband and while hearing music there is no issues. The sound quality is good and the bass is great.! This issue with the neckband is inconsistent and sometimes the issue gets cleared and when we unpair and reconnect the device, the issue still reappears. I have already applied for a replace and was able to find the same issue with the new replaced piece also."
"Absolutely rubbish. Sound quality and mic is good. But the problem is the battery doesn't last very long. As in bluetooth earphone should have a good battery life. Afterall you are spending 2k. But this one doesn't gove good battery life. There is no separate option to disable noice cancellation. Sound and mic quality is good. Band seems to be quiet strong. I think it is not very much compatible with other phone brands. That doesn't mean it wont work with other brands. I feel oneplus earphones work best with oneplus phone only. In all aspects. Pls watch proper review and comparison ( with. Realme, boat, soundcore) videos before buying."
Ideal for taking conference calls. Seems essential for any work from home professional. Battery backup is good. Missing switch between connected device option on this model. Material feel is good.
"Do not buy if you want to use it for calls, nor you or the person on other side can jear anything, chipping/cracking sound will be there for you. No one can hear clearly.Quick Switch is not fuctional, it takes 30-40 seconds to switchVery bad experience with Oneplus, never gonna trust this brand again.Music quality is goodBattery backup is good."
I had bought this after a review from my friend. Guess what this doesnt come out as I was suggested or the quality of product is dropped further. I might be dumb that I bought this even after reading very first review being a straight warning- Dont Buy. I bought neverthless. Now I repent spending 2k on this product when i could have gotten something better in low prices. Looks like One plus is just a shallow brand and stands up to saying of chinese product not lasting for long time. Wow. If I can I'd like to have my money back. But I cant.
"Sound quality, build quality, base all good.But problem I'm facing with this wireless earphone is connectivity issue. When ever i receive call and connect earphone voice dose not come even after setting everything. It takes too long time resolve this problem every time whenever I make a phone call.  I used to do off/on, factory setting, pairing etc. again and again to receive call voice in earphone.I'm done with this. I wanted to return but returning period has passed. 🤯"
I was more bass from earphone as it was names Z Bass edition..  but you wont get baas not even upto the mark.. very much disappointed with earphones.. especially its OnePlus. Stopped working after 7months only.. such a hopeless buy
OnePlus is a top notch trusted product now. I recently got note20 from samsung after using OnePlus 7 pro for 2 yrs but trust me no one can beat one+ . This headphone is another example of it .. pure sound and bass .love it go for it.
"I was expecting a similar experience with this earphone which I got from the old bullet wireless. But somehow it's not the same.1. Quick switch feature is not as easy as compare to the older version.2. Unlike the older version, microphone is present in the neck band itself. I liked the way it was in older version.Apart from above two things, overall nice experience with the earphones."
Jo purana wala version tha iska wo best quality ka tha is neck bend se aap calling karna to bhool hi jaobass version ke naaam kaata jaa rha h acha walaBattery backup bahut hi ghatiya h waste of money joJo acha product tha wo in lovo ne band kr diya OnePlus Wireless Z only
Most i like power on off switching settings in this neckband awesome sound quality not a loud but without loud a gud quality sound with a medium bass enough if high bass for call use cant listeen call audio clearly sound quality call noise cancellation medium bass neckband and wire bud buttons r really gud quality not breakable for gud quality neckband and and music quality this one plus bullets is really gud enough
No doubt it is the best option under 2k price range.<-awesome battery backup.<-fastcharging works like wonder.<-Bass is good.<-noise cancellation works fine.<-Observed latency in the Audio that is bit disappointing<-built quality A1<-overall performance is great!
"Cheap quality in the name of Brand.Bluetooth keep connecting and dis-connecting on every another call. After every call, it needs to be reset. Seems to be Bluetooth chip used in there is of around INR 100/- only. Overall product is to be like of INR 250/- only.Do not buy it. Its wastage of time and money."
बील्कुल आंख बंद कर के लेलो ।बाजार मे इतना कंम्फर्ट / नाईज कन्सलेन्स / फास्ट चार्जिंग / बॅटरी बॅकअप मेरी सोच से दूसरा कोई नही ।
"Even if my headset is OP 7t still it's latency is significant.they say that it's latency with OP devices are null. But it's not right atleast in my case. Gaming mode also doesn't help in this particular area.when you watch it ruins the dialogues of every movie and videos becouse of horrible latency. Guys you can have this band on neck if you are okay with laency thing. Sound quality is okay,Bass is good I must say,and design and finishing is best,I mean it can be reffered as OP brand's work. Thanks"
"Firstly, I was very much confused about which earphones to buy, i have also check many youtube videos to get the best neck earphones...believe me this neckearphones are just awsome go for it guys....you will not regert after purchasing it, i am damm sure. Dont be confused if your budget is below 1500 i will suggest wait for 10-15 days and then try to increase your budget to 1900 and go for this earphones. I suggest dont go for good product just go with the best one. This is the best earphones i could suggest u.Thankyou"
"Oneplus wireless bullet Z bass edition.They worked fine till first month of usage, later started giving a buzzing sound on every call which could be heard by the other person on call as well. After reading more about it, seems that wide no. of users have had this problem with no fix available till now. Awaiting replacement!"
"Best bluetooth headphone in this range probably, descent bass good design comfortable in ears ultimate battery backup and yes i know much of you expecting noice cancellation yes it works but not like apple buds but am sure u can hear that music when ur travelling in 120kms speed also and other can hear u on call with little bit of air go for it dont think much u cant get apple on this range i have experimented like lot of wireless but this is the one"
"I was using the old model, one plus earbuds which has a quick switch feature, which is very handy to switch between the devices. Keeping that in mind I brought this model and now I regret buying this, the feature is not available in this model and now It is hard to switch between my laptop and mobile."
I’m a big fan of One plus productssecond time I have bought these. This time the product doesn’t work only. Waste of my 2000/- . I am highly disappointed. My review is very late. Felt like sharing with the company. May be it helps them to get better.I ordered another brand cheaper instead of going through customer care. I wish it was easier to get things fixed. One plus being such known trusted brand.
"Update after 1 month of use.I am facing below issues.-1. There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues. It is known issue with the buds, and you need to reset the device to get it back, and then again the crackling starts in 3-10 hours.2. In middle of call it disconnect and reconnect after around 1 min, So I have to switch my phone output from Bluetooth to normal phone speaker and I am missing miss the conversation within that time period."
Its not working good!! Its been only 7 months that I have taken this product and one side is stopped working.
This item is very nice and smooth.  But one side is defected and low sound. This price is very high but i want to return immidiately. Amount Rs.  1999.00 will be return given detail account as soon.  Then when did pick up this item ?
"After so much research here and there, I bought this and yes there is no regret. Sound, battery backup, fast charging, connectivity all are excellent in this price segment. One thing which should be better is the comfort in wearing this for long as my ears started paining after using this for just half an hour. I never felt any pain in using Sennheiser cx 180 for longer period."
"I bought this for WFH calls. Needed a good noise cancellation mic. This solves the purpose well. Also the music quality really good.However, multi-device connectivity or a button to switch between laptop and mobile would have been really good."
"Ah! Ear soothing sound. Good deal in this price. Build quality is superb. If you charge it for 20 min you will hear for next 8-9 hours easily, which is quite good. But if it's compared to sony, it gives a healthy competition. The only point where it looses is the bass quality.Sony provides deep amount of bass as compared to this one.But that's fine.You won't be able to differentiate, when you get use to it."
"Waste of ₹2000.  Don't go for this bad product. I'm using this with OnePlus 6t device. But, After 3 week of use ,I start facing lots of problems.1. Call quality is very very bad. During calls the sound is distorted, like crack sounds.2. After 3 weeks of use ,I feel the volume of this device become low ...Overall the multimedia use is good. But I don't know why I'm facing problem during calls. Receive cracked voice..I really disappointed by the #oneplus"
"I purchased these headphones second time as the voice in the earlier one was breaking intermittently. I thought it might be due to rough handling.But after purchasing second one, the disturbance in calls is more frequent than the earlier one. All the headphones are having the same defect and the manufacturer did nothing to cure the same over a period of time. I am again searching for headphones which have clear voice quality."
Honestly there is a cracking sound that comes randomly during calls and while listening to music. I'll distrub ur music experience. I replaced that item but the newer one also comes with the same problem. Seriously OnePlus must look over that problem.Other than that Device quality and noice cancellation and battery life are good enough.
"Thr bass of the earphones is very poor. Ngl the sound quality of the earphones is good but the only thing that sucks about this earphones is there bass, so if you are a fan of songs like hip hop and stuff, this are not the earphones you should buy. Apart from that the battery of this earphones is fabulous. It's true what they said, with 10 mins of charging you can literally use this earphones for atleast 3 hrs maybe even more."
"I have bought this headphone 3-4 months ago, till time they work properly but now one side earphone is not working, i tried to register complaint for repair purpose, but they are not giving service, the excuse for it they don't have service center near about my location.If you cant give service outside your service center area than you also not sale the product outside your service center areaShame on one plus"
"This earphone is best for calling & connective things, bt I personally don't recommend for music lovers because when it comes to listen to songs or music this could be worst experience.NOT RECOMMENDED FOR MUSIC LOVERS."
"Good purchase,i feel like i have invested my money in right thing.Its a perfect neckband for every purpose and connectivity is also very nice,Thank you Oneplus for such a wonderful product and thanks to amazon also to deliver it so quicky. Go for it.Sound quality is best,bass is best,you may have to change the buds according to the size of your ears and buds of every size is present in the box so.Good product,go for it."
Reveiwing after 2 years of use very good product comfortable for long use base is also good connectivity is instant after 1 year of use some time it didn't connect for call but after some time it works normaly which is normal for any earphone.
"only audio quality is good, no switch between devices, dual pairing, quick switch every thing is just on paper, auto off when magnetic buds sticks together it's too much of automation leads to ear phone is not in on condition when needed."
It's not working with my redmi note 9promax  I have taken it to oneplus stores they just rest & give back they tell mobile is nit not good u need use this only with oneplus handset. Service people know about this that this headphones is not compatible with many mobile brands and it is not mentioned any very while ordering it they are & they tell it will not working for calling only use it for watching videos. Very bad response..
"I bought this product for good sound with bassMajorly every beat should touch the ear but this OnePlus Bluetooth is not giving beats as expected . I was disappointed at beat soundsBut overall performance, durability , sound quality, Wight of earphones  and battery performance are actually extraordinary.People can go ahead to buy this earphones 🎧"
"I have tinnitus and my ears start ringing like crazy if I use certain earphones. This is great for me, that being said, anyone who likes deep bass might be underwhelmed by it.I wanted to reach out to fellow people who had yo deal with tinnitus that escalates due to bass, this might work for you."
Noise cancellation is very bad some times my voice delivery is bad and disconnected my bluetooth and talking phone please improve the quality of noise cancellation other is good but noise cancellation is most important in a traffic we can't talking on bluetooth ear phones ( iam talking with my phone some times) not useful some time this wireless earphone please update on next model this features
Value for the money .... Better sound quality than Mi Neck band priced near 1900 ...far better than Boat earphone priced near 1700... working range is decent and better than other two...Only drawback is no noise cancellation...  But overall i am hapoy with the purchase..
"I started this product using two months ago, I found some problems one month ago.... I found a service centre near me to solve that problem. But in my first visit they told that they have no technicians to solve my problems(i think some covid issues)then I visit after two weeks they checked my product and they told me that the product is ok..... I still find mic is not working properly..... So i request that please help me for this issue..."
I bought this product around mid Jan and it’s not even a month and it’s not working . It’s practically dead. The Bluetooth doesn’t connect and pair anymore. It is a total waste of money
Overall I'm happy but somehow I miss the fineness that a 2k earphone should have. But I guarantee you won't notice it untill you are a heavy user of very good earphones. The sound quality is good and upto the mark.
Sound quality is very good. Bass quality is also good. Voice that other person hears on opposite side of phone is also superb & clear. Only problem I'm facing is that their is a lag when I connect it to my laptop with wifi or internet access is on. It doesn't work smoothly with internet on in the laptop but with internet off it works fine. Another big issue is that the mic doesn't work with video calling in via laptop. It's very much compatible with phone but the feature lags or doesn't work with laptop properly.
"I have used the old version of oneplus bullet z (not the bass version), that was perfect.. This one is loud when you play music or watch a video but in call volume is way too low.. I checked my settings it's on full volume yet its very difficult to hear the other person.. I made atleast 10 calls to different people to confirm the issue before posting the review."
I have purchased Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z earbuds. But in a week I'm facing connectivity issues with the product. Please replace the same or return the product.Waiting for your response.Thank you.
The built quality is excellent. You can get a feel from the plastic itself. Also the sound quality is great and noise noise Cancellation is good.The magnet in the earphones is quite strong and is safe to carry around. Battery life is nice. Overall great product and value for money.
"Don't purchase this product as it has very high bass, which is not balanced. So you won't be able to enjoy the original music of song. Also this product is completely useless as for the same price you are getting bullet z2 which has more battery life."
Please don't purchase product if you are having any one plus phone above One plus 7 version as the higher version phones has a bug. You will be hearing a static or robotic voice on and off while in a call (WhatsApp /normal/google meet ). Worst Oneplus buy ever.<< PS : Writing this review after replacing the product twice. If in doubt refer the oneplus forum>>
Excellent product. The noise cancellation is average but worth for this price. The voice gets breaking at random times. I don't know if it is a defect of the product I received or a universal issue. Anyway it is much better than the sony neckband I used before which is priced much higher and cannot be used for calls because of the amplification of outer noise.
I have used this product before and I have recently bought this product again.It is taking too much time to charge it even after 2 hours it doesn't indicate if it is charged or not.Also battery is draining fast compared to the old version I had before I lost it .. even after 1 year of usage.What happened to OnePlus?Giving quality products is not their focus anymore?
"I bought this headset from you 6 months ago. Worked well all this while but since yesterday, it isn't powering on. Resetting with volume keys isn't working. The device lights up when charging but once unplugged, the light goes off. Is there a solution for this?"
"after 15 days use,often there will be crackling sound.sometimes left earbud sound is gonecannot connect to 2 devices, which any 999/- headphone can.Sound quality not as good as boat headphone worth 1200/-.overall, not a good buy at this price."
I have used 2days while playing the movie and music some times I got cracking noise on the left side and my friends are taken after 2 months they allso facing the same problem. Plz don't at present OnePlus wireless z bass edition and thaks for the Amazon for refund..
I am purchase these bullet bluetooth using for only watching YouTube videos and songs and inka phone calls avariki ayna nenu chesina opposite person voice naku vinipisthundi Kani na voice valaki vinipinchadu and inka nenu purchase chesina 10 days ki am facing these problem and I am visited showroom and no response from show room and no service centre and still I have warranty but no use. Any way is there friends tell me
"Its bass is very bad i dont like it i have Many other headset likeJblSonySkullkandySamsungActually oneplus headset is very badPrice is very highIts not worth When u buy headset please read the customer reviewAm replaced the product second time.Dont waste your moneyTo my dear friends,Prevention is better than cure 🙃🤷🏻‍♂️And am forgot to tellIts made in china 🤣"
"The product in itself is really good, even compared to other bluetooth earphones, the noise cancelling and the bass is really good, also it stay in your year but doesn't feel like the vacuum effect. Can wear it for as long as you want and as a college student, it works for me for 3 days on a single charge."
"Does the job effectively what it is made for. I was reluctant to use it previously, bought 2 wrong products and then bought these. Excellent help for work from home zoom calls"
"Honestly, I thought this earphones being Just 1,999 would be average. I also had watched few reviews where in it was put up against boat rockerz 233. But I'm actually shocked with the sound quality and build quality. And also, I use a OnePlus phone so connectivity is seamless. You can use play/pause/previous/next track/vol up/vol down and also Google assistant on this. The only issue is it doesn't show indication when it's fully charged. I'm happy and you can go for it."
"Using since 7 days. Bought mainly for calling purpose. Caller gets my voice clearly even I'm driving two wheeler.1 more thing I'd like add, that when my phone connected to wifi n VoWIFI is on then other headphones fluctuate voice. But oneplus headphone is not that."
This is the third time i purchased oneplus bullets z Bluetooth earphones but this time i got defective product after 8 days of the use the right ear bud stop working.
Reasonably price Superb Product. Unmatched performance very much satisfied. BTW this is my 2nd repeat purchased product. So go ahead without any doubt. Also Thanks Amazon for trustworthy experience 👍
"I hated wireless earphones but because of my s20 FE , i had to opt for this option.Main purpose was for calls and have a quality mic , and it does a good job. Battery backup is also good enough. But maybe the current price is a bit on the higher side."
Hi EveryoneToday I purchased this One plus bullet Z series Z bass. I want to just convey to all who are reading reviews before buying product which very good habit that this is very good quality bluetooth neck band. Bass is very good and today I come to know that what is noise separation after listening this. I have two other neck band one for me and other for me daughter which is from Noise. But this is ausom. You can definitely purchase this with blind faith.

 Microphone recurrent problem….. replaced 3 times … 4 th time OnePlus service centre denied to replace or repair…. Don’t buy this product… go for something else … there r very good product available… but please don’t buy this . My experience with OnePlus is very bad .. I won’t buy any products of OnePlus company."
"The product is worst when it comes to call. There is a high static noise during calls. Useless if you're buying this for call.There is temporary fix, resetting the headphone and pairing it again. However this works only for few hours. After that again there will be huge static noise.₹2000 is down the drain . Could have bought any other local ones for 500-600.Worst thing , this happens only after the return window is over ."
"I used a boult headset before, it could simultaneously connect to two devices-mobile and laptop. However this OnePlus headset can connect to only one at a time. There is a learning curve in using this headset . Overall it's good"
I was assuming that since it's Bass improvised headset the bass would be good if not the best but it's much inferior than the typical boat headsets.. if u r specific about bass then it isn't the great choice. But battery back up is as promised and noise cancellation is perfect.
I was facing some problem with it as when i try to increase or decrease its volume a very disturbing sound comes from it and annoys you and later after 2-3 days the sound increased and kept coming in between music also. So i reached the service center and there was a huge line outside it only for the earbuds as everyother person was having the same problem with this product.
Don't Buy this product especially if you are fromBhubaneswar. As there is only one service center in Bhubaneswar.Secondly one plus bulet bass edition is a faulty product as went to service center three times in past 7 months regarding various issues no doudt they replaced. But I had to wait 14 days each time.another thing I noticed  everyday around 30 people comes to Service center only for earphone issue. So don't buy this one and please go for other brands.
"Have been using 365 days, 24x 7 - superb quality and noice cancellation. Best thing - it starts automatically when you seperate both the sides /unmagnet it and shuts when you put them together."
"Product,Quality,Voice,NoiceCancellation Is Good,But The Battery Level is Not as per One Plus Commited, I has to Daily Charge it, Even As per brand they suggest to Charge till 10Minute and we can enjoy till 7Hour but it's can't possible with this,Or I get it the defective piece from Amazon,Anything Would be happen as Brand Commited Wrong or Amazon was gave me defective or replacement Piece"
Before OnePlus earphones I used boat earphone which is better than this in sound quality. OnePlus's offering extra non necessary bass and that also pointy. Not recommending. Go for any other brand. Do not fall for OnePlus brand.
"This was my first try for one plus brand and I’m just surprised with the quality of products they are offering. I recently brought this one plus bullets neckband and I’m just loving it. The product design, sound quality Bluetooth connectivity, Bass, Calling experience, battery performance, everything is just perfect. Pro Gamer may face some latency issue with the neckband but I’m satisfied with the product."
"It went well for two months, after that again and again the accommodation is so intermittent, it gets so dirty, it hurts in the ears, bluetooth has to be turned off. Have to turn it on again and again."
Everything was good until Microphone stopped working in 5months. After that i got replaced from service center again microphone stopped working.. i will suggest go for BOAT price of 1999 is too high for these faulty headphones
"In one word, you can get headphones like this in Local brand. Audio quality is poor and 0% noise cancellation. Sometimes after connecting device, headphones not working with error device not working properly..... Overall waste product...."
"I purchased the product one week before. Initially it was ok. But after 5 days of use, i noticed voice break and some beep sound while calling. Then i applied for replace. After 5 days i have received  the replaced one and again i tested the call clarity. Unfortunately this item also having the se voice breaking issue. I think, they sended me the same damaged item. I just fed up with this item. Iam applied for the refund and i received the amount yesterday."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Very poor quality.It worked properly for 15 days now no proper sound, lot of disturbance.It will work only till 10 Days replacement policy❌❌❌❌❌❌"
"Ekdam bakwas product and service, november 21 ko liya hua ye product 3 january 22 ko working karna band hua , customer care ko phone kiya to kehte hai authorised service centre jayiye , no pickup available. Matlab yahase 1000 rs kharch karake service centre jana padega , kya fayada aise service ka . Plz bhai log or bahano ye product mat kharide."
This works well with laptop on teams call. Voice is clear and the range is also good. Good for music also. I bought primarily for business calls on teams. I recommend it for teams calls.
Battery life is not as expected. Earlier version had the best battery life almost same as advertised but not for this one. I have to charge them every day.Also they removed the dedicated quick switch button.And there's so much noise in the background during calls coming from the headset itself.Gets switched off automatically many a times a day while using.
Bluetooth definitely best!! Saves time in charging and has best quality of sound... Easy to use and carry! Easily connected to phone.. durable product. Light weight. Good for rough and tough
Dont buy the product i bought it from amazon in near about 2k on 6th August 2021And on 3rd September 2021 the mic stopped working very much disappointed with the quality though i use it only for 1 or 2 hrs in a day very much angry on amazon and Oneplus products
My first experience with a One Plus product and it is very positive. Happy with this purchase. Build quality is better than average. Sound quality is fine. I use it for mainly for calls. Do not expect too much noise cancellation either.
"Bass is good but it is not acceptable by a esteemed brand by saying that, bass edition has quick switch mode and not giving it. It is not acceptable from reputed brand. Other wise sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality is great"
"Product is quite nice with premium look and bass punch is very good but the vocals are somewhat not listened Clearly because of punch of bass although it's not so much , second is it's ear rubber bud's which are quite hard not so comfy for long hours that all about it and finally it's Bluetooth connectivity is very fast and impressive."
"Sony WI - C 400, MI earphones are much better than this earphones. Got faulty first time, got it replaced. Still sound quality, voice clarity is bit bad.The best price for this would be 500rs ."
Very ordinary sound.Not good bass.Poor noise cancellation.Don’t feel a sense of immersion I would feel on even a boat product.Learning from this buy: Don’t be deceived by the price not coming down as a sign of quality.
You can listen to music on decent volume but over a call this earphone is pathetic. I returned it the first time assuming must be some Internal issue but again I received same defected piece of frustration. I had received a lot lf good reviews personally because of battery life which is really nice but I don't understand what the problem is and I just want to throw this away when I'm over a call. Pathetic
"Not a value for money average sound quality.  I have did very detailed comparison between boat rokerz 255 pro + and this and found that one is best value for money and sound quality is almost identical, mic is quality is slightly better In oplus, very minute. But battery backup is really vast. 35 vs 15 hrs in Op"
"It's a sach good headphone , specially Battery because when engenged headphones then automatically turn off that a one of the good technology . And Yes if you are Bass lover something went to wrong not like dull just average Bass other wise call and other functions are Too Good ."
I bought this for online meetings and eas working fine but after 2 months people at the other end complaints that voice is not clear while using this earphone but when I remove this earphone then they receive a good quality voice. Not served my purpose after spending Rs. 2k on it.
Good sound quality. Product body also durable. Battery backup is just amazing. I used daily during walking for 30 mnts for that battry lasts for 1 month. Comfortable in ears. Loving it
Today the right side of the earphone stopped working. It did not last for even a year. I had purchased it last may. The quality can be better.
The sound is good for media playing but for calls it is not the right product because while attending the calls a buzz kind of disturbance sound is encountered all the time by which i have to shift to mobile speaker. The reason of buying this device is to attend the calls which is not satisfied. I want amazon to return back my money or else replace the item with the new one
Looking at this price range it has the best sound quality material is very durable and the charging speed and battery is just awesome
The opposite persons can not hear us due to worst noise cancellation...don't go with it ..too much disturbance while call on driving...otherwise normal purpose it's fine
The Volume control switch came off and fell somewhere within 6 months of usage. Poor quality.. Very disaappointed.. Other than that the sound effects are pretty good. But the product lasts for just 6 months at this price range is not acceptable.
"It's comfortable to wear,Easy to connect with Bluetooth.Good built quality.If you listen for long time, maybe harmful as noise cancellation is not that good compared to my Sony headset.Bass quality can be improved.Good buy at this price range"
"The sound quality is good, but the mic is not upto the mark, sometimes people can't here my voice in call then i need to swith off bluetooth and take call, it is not supporting some apps like instagram, Facebook while in call, we cant play reels while in call, whereas all other headphones i used support this feature, the battery performance is 14-15 hrs where company claim 17hrs at 60% volume"
Should not be available for other users who does not use OnePlus...sounds pathetic...In calls the other one can't hear my voice properly...Bass is on paper not in the headphones... Battery back-up is good...but what's the point without the sound quality...
"When compared to the previous model, this is a bit low inbuilt quality and also as the mic piece is adjoined with the main part, it would be difficult if you are using while RIDING or travelling in a public transport; as the person in the other end won’t be able to hear you properly."
"PUBG walo... Mat loo iise... Dur hi raho... Sound ka bohot issue hai... Koi bhi 400/500 ka earphone lelo agar sirf PUBG hi khelna hai to...Not recommend for base user... Sound is just as good as 600 rs of wired earphone, nothing is too special about sound quality.I would recommend Boat rockers 335 over this one blindly & any 400 RS of earphone for PUBG saves money..."
"First few days it was working fine but suddenly a crackling sound started, especially in laptop, it's very irritating. Also, all of sudden the volume turns down, microphone doesn't work, it doesn't restart.It's only been a month and almost everyday I face some of these problems .Okayish quality.Not worth the money."
"Surprised with it's built quality and battery life.Only one issue, the buds doesn't fit correctly in ears,take time to get used to it."
Please don't buy this if want to use this in two devices simultaneously.  You may not expect that almost all the other neck bands can use with two devices.  But this thing can use only in one device only. Even the switching option given in the previous model is not given in this and it is not clearlymentioned.
The worst product I had ever received from Amazon .Having lot of issues with the product.I don't advice the producti first received fake one and got it replaced and again that product was not upto expectations i love this bullets my old one was very good I'll try again and but this one
"Bass is just overpowered. I had other headphone with aptX HD, LDAC cosec which has much more clear sound output. This earphone is just using AAC that too preet bad."
Every time i answer call from my iphone i need to connect again to speak through it..it also happens that it automatically gets disconnected on call..i dont know about android but this is happening with my i phone..i tried with another iphone it is still getting disconnected..kindly take back this product
"First day they came, they were not working properly and with full volume it's making some noise inside the earphone and after the replacement requested, Amazon took the earphones the second day I requested and now they are taking 7-8 days for replacement and also Amazon customer service is terrible and at last this is the last time I m ordering from Amazon."
As claimed in product description charging for just 10 minutes well that isn't true. My product is taking up to an hour to get charged and just in 1 month this is the condition. I cannot return it now as according to return policy i can return it just within 10 days. Otherwise sound quality is good but I personally wouldn't recommend it. It is not worth spending Rs 2000. I would recommend boat than oneplus.
They do not support Quick switch like wireless z version. It's falsely claimed that this support quick switch. I bought this bass edition on review of normal wireless z but these are not good. Battery time is less. I am facing issue of call drop as well. Earphones automatically disconnect while on a call. Searched it on google and this could be manufacturing defect.
Waste of money with in 6 month one side it is stopped working even service centre people is not exchanging always saying product is out of stock overall this OnePlus earphone is very bad.
"There is so much complications while connecting two devicesAs compared to boat rockerz ... those are very easily switched between two devicesSo if you use two devices, this is not such a good productEvery time you have to connect from one device then connect to another"
Sound Quality : 10/10Noise cancellation : 9/10Bass : 10/10Durability: 10/10Worth for money: 10/10
The product that I have purchased for your site .I think that it will good in Quality but it was not good the sound that I want to hear it was in low quality and the charging is also not nice not good so my request is to you please carry it from my home as soon as it possible and refund my money so I can buy another product .It my request to you.
"While on going call opposite person cannot hear voice. Bought an expensive product thinking the quality must be good, but received a defective and poor quality product. Purpose is not solved. Unhappy with the product. Cannot buy or suggest to buy this product."
That I have been used only 3 month and become error not working. Starting was very quit impressive even I thought Oneplus is everything compared with other but not. I was maintained very useful but unfortunately Oneplus heart hurtme because If I'm in home than I can adjust but I'm far of my city very difficult to buy.
यह एक बेकार प्रोडक्ट है.... इसमें कॉल पर बात करते समय आवाज कट होती है जिस से आप को ठीक से सामने वाले की बात सुनाई नहीं देती...और आपकी भी आवाज ठीक से नही जाती....इस प्रोडक्ट को लेना टोटल पैसे की बर्बादी है.... केवल नाम पर न जाए....इसमें नॉइस कैंसलेक्शन का भी फीचर नहीं है इस से सस्ते दाम पर इस से ज्यादा फीचर वाले ब्लूटूथ मार्केट में उपलब्ध हैं
"Not working properly, gets disconnected after each call. Request support team to connect.It is as if some kind of a bug, that allows the device to get disconnect. Sometimes, we are on call, and audio switches to the phone, which is not only irritating but quality wise also bad!"
Very bad product...when connected to my one plus phone for calls there's always a lot of disturbance and static and i invariably have to disconnect the headphone. Defeats the purpose of the headphones...It needs to be fixed or replaced. Someone from the company pls help resolve this
Everything is best with this device.. Just neckband firmness and length lacking...Rest. Audio quality is awesome...Battery womt last either for 17 hr... But ok...Genuine feedback...  Go for it..
No quickswitch button. It's a pain to connect this to my work laptop and mobile.Quality has gone down for Oneplus.Oneplus no more. I should have seen the reviews before buying. I blindly trusted the brand.😂 Jokes on me.
"- best design,- great clarity of sound & awesome bassDon’t compromise by buying cheaper headsets. This is the iconic product for Bluetooth headsets."
"Right side stopped working after 2 months of daily usage. For such a cheap price I expected that it will last for around 6 months, but it hardly lasted for 40-50 days.OnePlus will not replace / repair this since they provide warranty ONLY for products bought from their website, and not on Amazon. Keep this in mind before purchasing."
It is good product. It takes only 8-10 min full charging and use for full day. You can buy. It is also water resistant. Can connect to any mobile.
The price  is not justified for the quality if sound and noise cancellation ability. Should be prices less than 1000
It don't work properly on AAC codec but work fine on SBC codecDon't buy if you are iphone user because you can't change bluetooth codec in ios it doesnt sound clear in ios a cracking sound is continuously heard.I replaced the earphones twice but it has same problemThe earlier version was perfectly working on iosVery disappointed by oneplus.
I use it primarily for office calls on laptop. Audio quality to me and other party is fantastic. WhatsApp call quality is also great. Go for it.
"Battery backup is good, pairs very quick with OP mobiles( Not used with other mobile so can't say about that). Sound quality is also good. After 3 months of uses no issues. Bought it based on real reviews...not online reviews. Don't regret the decision."
सर मुझे डिलीवर किया गया प्रोडक्ट खाली निकल गया और अब वह प्रोडक्ट अट्ठारह ₹100 का ही आ रहा है मुझे मेरे पैसे वापस दे दो मुझे नहीं चाहिए आपकी कंपनी से कोई प्रोडक्ट क्योंकि शुरू में डिफरेंट कलर प्रोडक्ट बो  2 दिन लेट पहुंचाया और दूसरी बार तो खाली डिब्बा ही मिला है सर प्लीज मेरे पैसे वापस लौटा दो मुझे नहीं चाहिए आपकी कंपनी से कोई भी चीज
"I have been using different products in search of quality then I came across this awesome shtt.. It provides you best bass,clear audio, epic surround effect, and virtualization.... No one can compete this.... And my it got stretched once and then one side was gone... Then Onplus warrenty just gave me a new one"
Have been looking for good bluetooth headphones for music and this serves the purpose. Its sleek and good features. Can be used for Voice call  as well as the mic is really good
Don't know why people go for ear buds I tried 2-3 products but they are not good notice cancellation problem is high fitting in ear is a issueSo go for this type
"Terrible - voice distorts when increasing or decreasing volume .NO DUAL PAIR. I called the oneplus tsore they confirmed that this model dors not have the quick switch unlike it being mentioned here . You have to go bluetooth settings and switch from one device to another.Buy the older version it has higher battery life , quick switch button and better in every way possible."
"These earphones are a scam.The battery doesn’t even last a full day of normal use, let alone get close to 20hrs as claimed.I am stuck with them because I got them to the UK with me. I curse the day I ordered them. Waste of money and time. Shameful from OnePlus"
Good company like OnePlus haven't done anything about this problem is just unacceptable. Whenever you call somebody there is noise in both caller and receiver's end. I don't know if this problem is only with OnePlus 7 pro or with any other devices. I hope this issue will be resolved ASAP.
"I was a Oneplus fan. But this one is an average product, You will get much more quality products with this price range. It doesn’t have noise cancellation and also poor mic quality, you have to put it over the mouth for clear audio calling."
"I like the band, but it is not 100% comfort, the battery backup was great. 10minutes charging on 30w charger get 12 hours battery life in half leval volume."
"Sound quality & battery back, bass etc is good but when connecting other devices we face issue as well as while talking on call other person doesn't able to listen us. It's noise cancellation & call quality doesn't work properly. For listening music it's good but for talking on call it's worse."
"Worst product. I have changed replacement this product, but no use. This headset makes some bad noise always. Mi (Xeaomi) is better than this. Very worst product. I honestly tell you all, I wasted my money. Don't waste your money. Purchase other better item oe other brands. This is my honest suggestion. Thank you"
"I would definitely recommend this product if your preference is calls. The battery back up is truly amazing! Lasts an entire day with a single charge.  Don’t expect too much bass. Doesn’t have noise cancellation. You will be heard crystal clear on calls. I spend 3 to 4 hours on calls on a daily basis, absolutely no complaints."
"Disappointed with the purchase! The earpiece is designed pathetically, doesn't fit right!! N if earpiece don't fit then what's the use of having earphones 🙄"
"Guys, please check policy before buying. They are trapping customers by selling bad quality product.  The product is ever worst than 599 headphone PTron which I brought.Please keep away from oneplus brand. I should have noticed no return policy, because means theya are not confident of their product"
"There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues."
The audio quality is nice but it gives a cracking sound after some time which is really disturbing so I had to replace the earphones. Bit the problem continued in replaced item too. Also the volume buttons started making the same sound when pressed!! Never expected these basic problems from brand like OnePlus!!!
"This is really one of the perfect earphone at this price range. It has a good base quality which you might be find quite less in compare to some Boult's earphones but except this quality the rest of other things are really benchmark at this price range. Sound quality is good and very balance. Calling quality is also very very good, look and build material is good."
"This is the my  second time to returning this Bluetooth because , having mic issue in this Bluetooth, very worst quality ..The person in front of me , he cannot hear my voice  clearly .....i am a big fan of one plus, i used one plus bullets wireless whis was 3999rs which was superb quality but this one is worst."
"I am really happy with the performance.... It is an amazing device having amazing Bass and equally good Mid and Treble .... Therefore, I consider this device very balanced and delight for any audiophile .... Bluetooth connectivity with Phone or any other device is very smooth and quick .... I hope company will also incorporate other upgraded features and may come up with a new model ...."
Pros:1. Packaging.2. Bass & Sound.3. Light weight.4. Comfortable while using in ears.5. Noise cancellation.6. Using one plus Dash charger battery got charged 100% from 20% in 25 minutes.
The only thing good about this headphone is it's battery life.The without bass edition is way better than this. Don't know why the company discontinued that.
This is a absolutely wonderful product. We the mid range customer have not had the guts to buy a headphone of  Rs 25000/ . This has fullfill the taste of hearing good sound. Believe me its good and worth buying. Will review it after using of 1 or 2 months. I think it will stands tall.
This headphone is tremendously amazing if you are looking to use it everysingle day. I use this all the time its fab and durable. The charging time is just 10 mins it will be ready to use again. This does gets damaged after an year or so(I kniw this because this is my second purchase) Go ahead and buy.
Earphones are excellent. I'm charging once in two days.. even with heavy use. And charging it is easier than a charging a mobile.
I ordered this after so many of positive reviews but with in seven days one ear bud is not working. Highly disappointed. Wastr product
"The beauty is that once this is paired & connected, it can resume connection as soon as you put the ear speakers into your ears."
Pros1. Superb Build Quality. Sturdy Design.2. Awesome Bass.3. Not missing Quick Switch Feature from Old OP.4. Best Call Quality so far. Noise cancelling is not selling point for this earphones.ConsNothing as Such. Just go for it. I bought this with 2K.
"Mic doesn't work. Tried it with multiple devices, still no luck. Apparently a lot of people are facing the same issue, still OnePlus has not official guide to fix it. No quick switch button. And the way in which they say we can switch between devices doesn't work 90% of the time."
"Bought it in sep 2021.no doubt it was working fine .since yesterday, mic stopped  functioning. Ear price are still working fine.m using it while watching OTT series but unable to communicate during calls .What's the procedure to claim warranty.."
"After six month usage, best Bluetooth headset I ever used, comfortable nice build quality excellent sound quality"
"One plus earphones are awesome, different from any other because of their sound quality. One of friend suggest me these earphones as he is using since last more than 1 year & he didn't face any problem upto now. These one plus earphone are best among all that I used in last 5-6years."
"Crackling sound while hearing songs, and Bluetooth got disconnected often when there is a call, when switching between Bluetooth devices From your mobile it doesn't connect back. Wasted money on this. If someone interested in buying OnePlus bullets z bass edition, don't do it. Go for realme buds wireless Neo 2"
"I am a music lover,as per my opinion this is Awesome Bluetooth,Sound Quality,bass, battery  backup all things are Superb"
The product is good but not worth for 2k..Noise cancelation is not working in this earphone.  100rs earphone is better than this when it comes to noise cancellation...While calling the voice is not coming in crystal clarity.. exactly it worth for 700rs that's it other 1300rs is for oneplus brand not for earphone
Do not buy if you don't have bluetooth 5.0v trust me it will give lot of issues if bluetooth version is below 5.0 and you can not return it once you buy it will be replaced and same thing happens again.
Best for travel and home use. Bass is not upto the notch. But you cannot get this battery life in anyother headphoneas. I would use it for one full day(24hrs) with one time full charge(calls and music) and 5hrs with 10-15min fast charge.
Got a brand new piece (that’s always my major concern). Glad got it over Amazon than OnePlus as it’s more convenient. Got a good piece!
10 minute charge gets me going for a day easily. ~ 6 hrs use. Quality of sound is also good. Slightly expensive but product quality ensures you don't complain about the extra price
"Everything is fine, sound clarity, Bass, battery back up is also good, especially the magnetic fields on the back of the bullet type ear piece which plays very good role for long battery life, which cut off from the phone if we stick to each other and immediately connects as.soon as we detatch. One thing I would like to say the noise cancellation is not good."
When we compare to old 1+ z wire is very thin charging time is little more magnet is half stronger than old bass is little bit more than old otherwise quality is very less and the same price 2k dnt know abt durability...truly business
After 1 week of usageWorth to buy for 2k.1. Sound quality (bass)2. Comfortable while using3. Easy to access4. Charging for 10minutes you can watch one movi  Oneplus other than smartphone users can buy this headset.
"Whenever I pause the music/video, it’s keep on disconnecting and connecting. Most of the times when I play the music again after a gap, it will be in disconnected state. Very irritating."
"I missed the return window on this item. But right now, it's neither getting charged, not working. There's a weird rain noise continuously coming out of the buds even though it's not connected to any device."
Please Don't buy this ...Bad quality of product build quality ..My volume key cover lost while driving ...It is not much stronger as I expected... Please don't try one pluse ..And I come to service center they dineid ..To take back ..So try other brand cause ..They don't serious about coustemer satisfaction..
"Unfortunately, I didn't do enough research, but if you are reading this - Stay away from these headphones if you want to use it to take calls. Barely 2 weeks and people can hear static when I speak.The only good feature is the magnetic autoconnect but you can find the same feature in a cheaper headphones."
"This earphones are best in sount but when I see any video there is a buzzing noise in background. I have tried resetting earphones, removing phone cache, etc. But issue is still there. I hope this is helpful."
"After using 2 months I wrote the review quality is good but after two months there is lots of problems comes it's doesn't take charge and also not connected with mobile ,so if you want to buy this doesn't buy Amazon/Flipkart just go directly to shop they given 1 year warranty . It's good Thanku"
"Not at all satisfied, if you use this continuous for 1 hour than your ears will start paining and lead to infection in ears. Can seller please let me know whether there is manufacturing defect or quality is like this only?"
Pros- Overall the experience is good.However couple of cons.1. It takes way too much time for a new device to get connected.2. Noise cancellation is partial. Not much effective.3. Battery back up is not up to the mark.
The headsets have become garbage for me in just 9 months. One day it was working and then suddenly the headset stopped connecting to my phone. I tried almost everything but it doesn’t even pair now. No issues about the sound quality but built could have been better
"No noise cancellation, decent sound quality, and no bass whatsoever. Can't be used for long hours."
Device is fine also sounds good but i got microphone issues in this device and oneplus is not replacing i want to tell everyone that audio devices are not repairable as per company policy & company always give replacement in case if u get any issues with your audio devices
"No doubt this has best sound quality but the worse things are battery, no codec, no switching button.Hence we better to switch to another brand"
Middle button of the earphone ( used to play the next or previous song ) is not working .Trying to find a way to claim the warranty and to return it but not seeing any option to do so . Not even to talk to the customer care..
Only 15 days I used it.. after that I m trying to get service but unfortunately I didn't get yet.
This new model is completely garbage. Audio keeps on disconnecting while video goes on. I thought mine was defective and replaced but new one also had same issue. Don't buy. Also all good reviews and stars are for the old model. Amazon just included them in this new one. -5 star from me.
There is a weird distortion sound between calls because of which i have to disconnect the devcie again and again to reconnect when ever it happens .
"Anyone takes Bluetooth(Neck band) from this company(One plus) , first of all I wish to know that if you have a mobile of Mi (Xiaomi) , then do not take it because in the beginning the sound comes right but later unwanted noise (rattle) starts coming and on going to the service center refuse to replace."
"I heve order many no. Of this product . Everyone is exchanched men two times due to any problem in neckband , like sound , like one earpiece is working , like disconnection problem"
This definitely is a little expensive as compared to others but the sound and quality is out of the world.Sound quality : 9/10Sturdiness : 9/10
Far better than other ones I used long lasting battery is a big plus. Bass is ok can be used to make and receive calls in traffic also. Thanks Amazon
"Bahut saari problems hai iss model me.Na to call quality thik hai,na hi sound quality.Microphone cheaper quality ki hai,thodi si piche jaane pr sound bahut hi km ho jaata hai call pr..."
"With in 20 days it stopped working, as I have not used much ..  I have a lot of trust in this brand but from now onwards I will not buy. Please do not buy ... 😡"

 Very very bad experience from Amazon ,i didn't expect from Amazon , I ordered OnePlus wireless z bass edition but got old model damaged product totally disappointed it doesn't work , product package already teared inside the courier box"

 Don't buy this one plus bluetooth Bullet z because call drop issues we are facing wrost services"
Backup is good. Sound quality is not bad. As per my requirement I need some more clear / clean sound. Bass is good not to say Z Bass. Its like ordinary neck bands which we get in below / near about 1000 rupees. I am disappointed after buing this product. Please go with Sony or other branded neckbands.
"Sound quality is good, need to work on noice cancellation and when we want the bass it should sync properly , otherwise it will not give clear sound"
There is no noise cancellation.sometimes while calling Bluetooth connection will disconnect. We cannot answer what's app call by Bluetooth. If we are in WhatsApp call and we get any call on sim Bluetooth connection will automatically disconnect ( pick up or not)  and need to connect manually.
I gifted this one of my friend and it's been almost half a year still it's like a new and no problems faced till now and sounds great with a decent bluetooth range
Right side earphone is not working properly. I have returned the first that i bought but again they re sent the product. Still im facing the same problem.
"Product quality is awesomeBattery has jumping percentage, it will show 60 % and in no time it Will be 20%Bass is ok.Volume is loud"
Mic stopped working after 10 days. Service provided by the oneplus care is really frustrating. They held the device over a month. I still not receive the device from service center. Hope they make it work well.My suggestion is not to buy this instead you go for boat or samsung level1 etc.
"So far so good.Good choice under 2k.pro's: sound quality good. comfortable, mic quality no compliments yet. battery good. type-c charger cable, Bluetooth 5 connectivity. build quality good.cons: No issues were noticed."
Amazing sound qualityLong battery lifeAutomatically connect & disconnectPremium qualityWorth for every penny
"Update after 1 month of use.There is crackling sound in the background that comes during calls games music anything randomly. During calls, once the crackling starts, it continues. It is known issue with the buds, and you need to reset the device to get it back, and then again the crackling starts in 3-10 hours."
"Battery life commendable, sound quality and noise cancellation are amazing. Resistance to sweat and water is another plus."
I had taken this product months back. And now the voice calling is an issue. There's a cracking voice in the calls which is disturbing. The music can be listened properly. No help from the OEM
"For Warranty service center asking box, I don't ve box they r not accepting without box it's 25days only when bought it stopped working not charging n not switching on"
I have used both type of earphones the normal one and the bass variant. The normal earphone was good compare to bass variant. The bass variant earphone price is high battery quality is not upto price and the sound is ok. I have written the review after using 4months of product
Overall it's okay but one which is defect in this is if you speak long the sound getting automatically slow downThen again you have to disconnect the call and recall for clear voice

 Cool packaging. The band is solid yet quite flexible. Bluetooth connectivity is superb. Charging fast.Sound quality is good.Cons- no cover/cap on charging slot.Looks and color are average."
I bought it 6 months ago and now the left ear phone is not working. No sound from the left ear phone. Hope it covers in 1 year warranty.
Perfect fit to ear and sound also good. On off control in magnetic earpiece is plus for this headphone. Quality also good. Deliverd within 2 days thats great.
"One plus has made a very good headphone good fit, awsome sound quality and moderate to good telephone conversation"
"I was wondering when it failed to connect with Phone, it's not working after 10 days. I don't know what is the use of company product that we use  it's totally waste of money Rs/1799.i was really disappointed with the product .I was trying to return but return window is closed .I don't know what to do now."
Connection drops every few minutes. The problem gets worse as days go by. I have a piece which is less than a couple of months old. It is paired to an OnePlus 7 pro. I can't even watch a 90 minutes movie without the audio dropping some 10 times in between. Oneplus is not what it used to be.
"Just after a month of receiving these earphones, there was a static buzzing sound when on call. The people on the other end couldn't talk to me cause of the noise which was much more prominent than my voice. It's the worst product that I've ever purchased from Amazon. I normally don't write good/bad reviews but this forced me to"
Very easily paired with Android phone. Very less battery consumption.charging time is very less. Purchase without any hesitation.original nice packing.
After using for a month a cracking sound during calls has started … there is connectivity issue … sound while calls gets cracking after some time of call .
"Pros :Sound quality is best.Battery life is Maximum.Bass volume is good, differs while riding a bike.Magnetic turn on and off.Cons :I'm using since 5+ months, if you're new user then your ear starts paining."

 Its been only 6 months that I have taken this product and one side is stopped workingI have warranty want money back or replacement"
This is the Best Buy for a Bluetooth headphone neckband. No other product comes close to this. Magnificent!!!
Good product with this price range. Sound quality & performance is awesome...thanks....🙏🙏🙏
Very bad Bluetooth earphone .Do not buy it otherwise your 💰 will waste.For 1 week it was good 😊 but after some time was waste.Same condition was of my friend.You can buy Sony or other brands but do not buy this earphone.Thank You 😊💞
"The sound quality is Ok, the extra bass that they promise, seemed like they just increased the volume of everything which kind of compromised with the sound quality at higher volumes.Performance, connectivity and portability are all good.For Sound quality just because it had a zz sound at higher volumes i would give it 3/5"
This headphones produces cracking sound and it feels very cheap. I'm using honor phone and facing this with this brand new earphones from day one. Don't blindly go with YouTube reviews. How's that sound? - It is similar sound as if any wired headphones connector moves in middle of songs. Cracking!
Initially when I charged the earphone it get turned on and was working but day by day it was getting defected and now it is not turning on even after charging. It is thw first time I got a defective item from amazon which was not expected. I want to replace my item. @amazon kindly do the needful. This is not expected at all.
Been a constant fam of OnePlus products but this one dissapoints. There is constant noise and voice is heard robotic on either side during calls from this earphone. Thought maybe defect with particular set but the exchanged one turned out same. These robotic voice issue is constant and too irritating.
"PRODUCT CLAIM OF NOISE CANCELLATION... NT THERE. AT THIS PRICE, IF NOISE CANCELLATION IS MISSING... PRODUCT NEEDS 2 B RETURNED, NT REPLACED. PL ARRANGE FOR RETURN & REFUND, WUD LIKE 2 BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT"
"Yes very Good Product &battery🔋 life n very goodfast charging,Only 10 -15 minutes charging time is requiredC-Type charging,"
don't waste your hard earned money on this faltu product. I bought received this product on Thursday and today is Sunday and I m hardly use this airphone just 2or 3 hours whenever I tried to use it always in discharged condition..poor battery life very poor.
I have been struggling with earphones for a while. Finally got these a while back. The battery life is pretty good. Once I am done using I can just attach it with magnet and its turned off. It connects to the device immediately when I detach it. The sound is really good and the mic is pretty good too. Loved it.
"There is a static noise that remains for little bit of time, whenever you use it and the bass gets a little high the voice starts to break. Also it sometimes disconnects automatically from time to time, the one plus bullets Z normal edition is much much better than this."
"Died in the middle of a call after barely a month of use. Won't switch on now. No damage whatsoever.EDIT: The earphones resumed working after a few attempts of trying. Still, don't like the fact that they had to die on me unexpectedly."
The product is with a good finishing and call quality is awesome...  Very good compatible with one plus 9 pro.. have a long bluetoothe range
Very bad product... I really shocked about one plus neckband.. whlie receiving the call that time the band is automatically disconnected. That's y I return the product for repair on 28th Nov. But still I didn't get any status about my neckband.. very worst product I ever seen in my life...
"This lacks the quick switch button that older OnePlus bullets wireless Z had.And beleive ne if you have used the older earphone you will miss that features a lot.Otherwise a great earphone.Great sound quality, great battery life. Very ergonomic."
After replacing my product is working fine. I didn't find any mejor issue after replacing. Given 4 star because of the overall experience is not so good as i think. But I'm satisfie now.
I bought 3 pcs in Jan 2021 Republic Day sale one for me and other 2 for friends. And we all faced same issue that this has broken due to poor Build Quality. Now left side speaker has stopped working.

 Good product...Sound quality was goodNoise cancellation okokBattery superBuilt quality goodBut have some issues with cleartyOverall good product"
Good Quality Bluetooth.  Responsive and durable. Only issue I had is the magnet switch which is turning off the Bluetooth when out of your ear while hanging. So need to have it in your ear always even when not in use
My earphones stop working in between anytime.They work again only after attaching and removing their magnets.
"This one didn't last a month, there is lot of interruption in Bluetooth connectivity and ko clear voice on calls."
No complete noise cancellation.Bass quality is average.Not satisfactory on this price.Build quality is not that good.
Battery life: GoodStyle : MediumBluetooth settings : ExcellentSound effects: PerfectValue for money ? :  Absolutely!!!!!
One side doesn't work and One plus replacement procedure is the worst. I have been waiting for 2 months to get it replaced. Visited the store 2 times. Once they did not accept and once they were busy selling the new product so they asked me to come again
Static noise. Bass not affective. Too expensive. Apple wired headphones are far better that this one and is in the same price range.
Sound quality not good compared to oppo.My opinion oppo good.In oneplus back side resound coming.That is the draback.This is my opinion only.2000 waste.. Take a good decision.My opinion is in sound quality sony and oppo are best.
Good sound quality ( not the best though )It could have been better. But it's very good for this price range. I'd recommend it!
Works like a miracle with oneplus phone. Auto detection on bluetooth phone and superb sound quality. Light wiegh and clear call quality.
"Excellent Sound quality, Ease of connectivity and good range of Bluetooth. Even at near full volume you can enjoy thumping sound without hurting your ears and the persons around you won't be able to listen even slight of the sound."
"Doesn’t switch between 2 devices,Earphones doesn’t turn on sometimes.Button issues"
Huge disappointed with this product not proper working in my laptop after replacement i think i was looted ...crack sound in laptop when you increase or decrease sound
"This is not at all suitable for a person who roams outside, the previos model with seperate mic was better compared to this,. This is suitable only for a person who works within office."
Within a month right earplug stopped working. Now can hear the music from left earplugs only right one stopped working.Worst product ever from OnePlus. As service centers are limited only there is no service center near my hometown. So much disappointment from this product.
Writing review after one month of use... Starting it was good.. But sometimes doesn't connect for calls and eventually after a month mic stopped working..... Even my friend experienced the same and he returned the product... So better not to go for this unit..
"Pros: withstands charge as committed, Clarity in voice and fits the neck perfect.Cons; Switch not available. If it had been, pure bliss for WFH"
I am a Sony fan. First time I bought non Sony brand and this 1+ bullets are mesmarising with the great sound quality. I really loved it and will recommend for all music lovers.
Like the quality but definitely  the old version  was  perfectly  designed.. the mic and buttons were located  perfectly....new one is good but it would be  perfect.. ..i personal  prefer  old versionLove  Oneplus.. but this time i disappointed.. with bass Edition
"The neckband is very good, mic quality amazing. Sound quality also better than old version. But there is no multiple devices connection option and device switching button."
"Wonderful sound, best quality. I'm purchasing this product 2nd time. I had purchased it 1 and half year before due to physical damage it is no longer useful."
"Excellent product battery backup too nice automatic on off (tuch boath with magnet) is very fantastic ideaSound quality not too loud nor less but in average, noic ecancellation excellent ,bass quality veery high which is hart of voice, overall very nice products thanks to Amazon"
The sound quality is very good with bass and on single charge we use them for 17hrs which is exceptionally good.
"Not as Aspected ,It's mentioned in the features that bass edition have quick switch option, but their is no quick Switch Button. I guess they have just copy paste features from their older edition to bass edition, so not aspect this from Oneplus...😢😢"
Lovely sound. Each and every content of the music is clear and balanced. Best bass.Scarely fast bluetooth connectivity.Go for it guys to get the best in its range.
One plus is a good brand as usual. From 2000 to 1800 has been drop so it was a good opportunity for me to buy. Fully satisfied with the product.

 Very good product.Noise cancellation is not up to the mark"
After a lot of search finally found this and since purchase I haven't had a moment of regret. Highly recommended.
"While sound was good, the right side earphone stopped working within 2 weeks. Had used it only twice and one side stopped working all of a sudden. None of the Amazon reviews speak abt this issue. But if u google the problem, realised this is a common problem with most one plus ear phones!"
I dislike this product..purchased on 10 nov 2021...n on 18 nov 2021 it stopped working..I tried charging..bt it's battery drained..whn I tried to strt it..I take care of products..this is really shocking for me k itni jaldi it stopped working without any physical damage
Does not Expect this from OnePlus...There is some cracking noise comes from one ear of headphone and its really irritating never expected this.....also i replaced the first product but the second product also having same issue.... really disappointing....i returned the second product too...
The first review that I am posting for any devicePros-1 Great battery life2 Excellent voice quality3 Excellent call quality4 superfast connectivity5 Fast chargingCons:Makes using products of other companies difficult
"This product is not good , while speaking some extra sound will be their not able to speak using this product, so i want to return this product"
I don't understand why the company is not considering all types of software development in designing a device...most of us r complaining about mic problem...I hope at least now they may provide exact driver of any crack file to make the device to function in all androids the best.. that is resolving mic issue
"Sound is just too good. Noise cancellation should be improved.Battery back up is awesome.After using few months the magnets are becoming week,as a result the headset remains always on when inside the bag.There should be a dedicated on/off switch."
This is my honest reviewNo doubt go for this productBalance sound quality with deep bass and loudI don't know why there is more negative reviews for this product

Price is worth it 😉 if I talk about this Earbud.Bass is superb 👍 packaging was good.M Happy with OnePlus product
"Great set of Bluetooth earplugs. If you're tired of using average ones for a shorter while and experiencing discomfort at times, I'd suggest go for these. A bit expensive than the 'go to' ones in the market but they're a great investment."
Hurts in the ears after sometime. Overall good
Rugged and best... Somehow I lost them speeding at 145 km/h listening Pink Floyd on my motorcycle. Just have placed a new order. 🤦‍♂️
Its okayish. Similar products with similar quality can be found at much cheaper price point.
I bought this in bluetooth january and now when i am listening to the song the voice is coming right but there is a disturbance sound on the voice call
I wana thank you to the one plus Brand for making such a Amazing Earphones the bass quality is ultimate when I watch Movie its feel like i am in movie theatre Its cancel the all surrounding noies when you use earphones and sound quality is good and they need to upgrade the battery low compared to normal edition
Unless you have one plus phone this is good pair of headphones but sound quality I didn't like (JBL user) it's too much bass and crisp richness and separation is not so good.Also there is no low latency mode in other devices.Battery life best in segment.
"It's a worst product quality is good only  few days after returning date is over.  it's having problems like disturbance during call, voice distrotion, speaker problem or water of product n waste of money not work properly."
"Sound qulity, connectivity and Battery back is good only. But we can't use this while travelling. No noise cancellation at all. Catches all out side noises.  If you want to check the noise cancellation do a voice clip in whatsapp. Its horrible"
"Poor quality, left side speaker not working, mic not working. Within 10 month product going  dead jone while I am using with safety. So don't buy this product 😭, and you can choose realme oppo and other brands at this price segment."
"Overall I would give it a 3 star. Sound quality is great. The only problem that I encountered with the headset is, when connected to a non oneplus handset there's lot of glitch in line over call.Other than that you will experience finest quality of sound."
Day 1 review..Charged 100%== 3hrs usage==30% battery remained.U can decide.
"Its a good product but just for 6 month because after six month it will be got worst and if you get replace this piece, it will Again work  6 month"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Best in classNever compare this products from  any mid range other brand like boat or noise in this price segment.Built quality is perfect and flexibleSound and bass is best 🙂I love this product"
"Bass - Perfect, enogh boom to it, Doesn't destroys other frequencies.Vocals - Crisp.Build - ExcellentComfort - eartips are bit large,even the smallest one🥲 and they hurt my ears initially. I started using eartips from my jbl c100si and it feels better now😌."
"Nice headset that fits well. Sound quality is decent enough for the price, but there was some delay in sound. the battery back up is also good."
"Voice=better, butSometimes it automatically cut off from connected device and again I have to connect to connect it.AndNot properly charging,or getting long time to get fully charged.(2hrs).AndEven it get fully  charged it shows red light.Above all after using 5 months"
"Simply Impressed with , product quality , sound quality in one word its a masterpiece,  you cant get better then this in price you pay ."
Left earphone volume kept going downNow low volume in left ear.Now in high volume scrating sounds are being producedMic is not so good better only for 3-4 days then call quality keeps degrading.Not returnable.Wasted my moneyNever buying again
Use for connecting call and listning music.but all ihave to control by phone since beginning i hhad to move out of station the day i received so checked now there was no extra ear buds also appears that some defective return was sent to me without refurbishing.
"Sound quality is good. Active noise cancellation needs to be better as while on call, lot of surrounding noise and disturbance is captured which interrupts the on going call/meeting.Battery backup needs to be improved. It gets discharged earlier than expected."
"Good sound qualitie for a wireless earphones, and good noise cancellation. But it can't connect simultaneously to 2 Bluetooth devices"
I am hearing an noise while hearing songs or watching videos i replaced and got refunded for 4 times even i am using iPhone 11 and also i checked with other smartphones I don’t know where the problem is
Very dispointed will this product... Because while connecting to call ...it's automatically disconnecting and after 10-15 sec later connect. If complaint also there is no proper response from one plus store.please don't buy this product.... buying this equal to put money in dust bin.
"Good,music is  descent quality for the money we pay. Good thing is call quality , it is awesome and recepient never complaints on call quality. It's good for the calls and serves the purpose cleanly. Sound is descent not great"
OnePlus is definitely best. The earphone is very good. The turn off and on system is unique and wonderful. Sound quality and bass system is also good. Hope it works for long run too.
Super earphone. I give5 starafter 2 month using. Spper sound quality and battery backup is very longer than other. So. Everyone can buy blind the eye.
"The earphones are meant only for music and if you are planning to buy it for gaming stay away from it.Right side earphones sound reduced after 1 month of using and now I have to avail the warranty.Also they are very delicate, I used them cautiously and still they got spoiled."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The product is best 👌  Amzing experience asa well as build quality is very good 👍"

 It's not pairing with mobile and right side is not working I was unable return the product which is not available. Then there is no Option for replace also time factor will say cruel"
No noice cancellation in this product. My original product mic stop working with in one month after complaint to one plus customer care... Company exchanged my product but I recieved after 3-4 weeks
Superb product for daily use. Call quality (noise cancellation) is very well maintained. Battery backup is also descent. You cam enjoy music and videos with great sound. Bass quality is medium.
"After 6 Months it's not working properly, atomatically Blutooth getting Disconnecing again reconecting.. not happy with this product."
The best neckband it is light in weight and also the bass is excellent. Very happy with the connection process. Very quick and responsive
"Not good, replace two times but the same problem persist. This product have a continuous crackling noise at background while listening to something, moreover during calls it disconnect automatically and leaving call on normal mode.Not a good product."
"Day by day one plus have issue in performance , duplication and refurbished.. all are refurbished product...Not good defective price received once, after I replaced , this one also defective mike not working ..Poor performance..."
"Battery back up and charging timing , no fast charging.no 10hrs battery back up once charged,Only 2-3hrs back up."
Automatically connect when buds are separated gives a hands free ability to save from boring procedure of powering on the Bluetooth and connecting it to devicesGreat sound qualityAmazing baseComfortable to ears
"I wonder why some people said, bass is too much. Rather there is no bass at all. Dissappointed."
The product is not functioning from the first day.As I didn't use it immediately after I received....I couldn't give a return resquest
"I received today one plus wireless neckband z , I'm very surprised as company commit charge 10 min and you can enjoy music 10 hrs it's totally fake commitment. Battery performance is worst, and other things is very impressive."
noise during callsotherwise its a very good product in terms of battery and sound quality
The only drawback is battery life is verg poor and it's somehow waste of money moreover sound quality is good bass is just excellent no issue is pairing and very flexibleAlso Amazon only have to replace the Item not return that's painful
"Product is good. Connectivity also good. Sound and bass nice. But noise cancelations is very bad. Its very difficulty to talk while in driving. Facing Too much disturbence. Normal calling is good.And also Sound up and down buttons also have problem while pressing the +, - buttons"
I received one plus earphones but I think so there is some technical problem in this. This ear phones automatically disconnected with my Bluetooth and I have to do it manually on off Bluetooth and I have to connect again and again very disappointing.
Sound quality is not good. Base is also low. For listening music it is not recommended. Sounds clearity is good while taking through it.
I've ordered same product two times and both the time got same issue. Voice is coming in e right side only. And not able to download the invoice also bcz of this service centre guys are not entertaining this product.
"The product is an used one, the earpieces are filled in ear wax that is so disgusting.And the receiver is not working it seems.A complete disappointment."
1. Sound Quality Overall ok but not best.2. Noise Cancellation is better than expected.3. Battery 🔋 Backup 3 to 4 days on average rough use.Overall go for it. This gadget is extremely cool and healthy on this price range.
using it from one month ... honestly the product is truly recommendable . in terms of battery life and audio quality call quality noise cancellation it is justified product.
Best bluetooth headphones with better sound. The fast charging feature works like charm. Can be used for almost a day of mixed usage. Another feature was quick switch meaning I can switch between two paired devices by double tapping the pair button.
As compared to my previous wireless earphone(which was around 400 :D )this has much better sound quality  + clear voice calls as per current experience.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Actually after 2 months it is sound quality was very worst and another four months some parts of volume control buttons are fell down totally this is not the recommended device"
Battery life is roughly 3-4 days but depends on usage. Bass quality is good and it definitely is a value for money
Ear lock system failedMy ear painOn of paten not matching so long time call add
The product i till try to connect to the device motorola one fusion plus but till not connected

"Delivered a cheap product but there is no fault of ""Amazon"" because it is only a platform where services makes easier.for these kind of bed product ""Appario retail private limited"" company is responsible. If there were ""0"" rating, i would like to give the same this seller"
I am happy with the headphone but it stopped working exactly 1 year after purchase. First the left earplug stopped and then right also in few days
"From quality to performance , it's the best in last one year ..Battery just superb, sounds too good ,also fast changing supported . Fabulous ...."
First I have ordered OnePlus bullets and received diffective bluetooth and I requested for replacement. In replacement order I have received one bowl instead of bluetooth. Now again I have ordered OnePlus bullets and I received only box without bluetooth 🥺
Pros:1. Really super fast charging2. Lasts long3. Good with soothing musicCons:1. No bass2. Earphones virbrates in your ears causing a tingly effect when you go for full volume.3. No active noise cancellation
1. Its magnet not get auto attached. We have move the sides to each other earbud to make them attached.2. Sound quality is fine. Not superior.3. Wire is little hard and underquality.4. Not expected from oneplus.
My mom love this Headphones +Battery Backup and Long Bluetooth connectivity just Kill in it.
"One important drwaback is that of multiple device connection, it does not have that you need to either switch it off or disconnect from one device to connect with another one of your paired devices"
"Sound  quality ,noise cancellation and bass quality is amazing no comparison with other necbands . Best item by one plus  but i think one plus should have put bigger battery in this item because its not enough with this price . that's it ."
"I have to gift this to my friend so I ordered it before. But when I opened it, it was defective. there are some annoying noises while calling. I wanted refund or replacement but it was too late. 7 days were gone. i want warranty claim in this product which is for 1 year."
"I ordered these on 4/7/21, and within a week, one of the earpieces no longer functions at all. I had the same pair before these, which lasted close to a year for me. Would not recommend this edition, however."
"Cheapest sound quality, not soothing to ears. very bad--OnePlus, just hyped brand, they cheat with nice packing--but products experience will not meet expectations."
"Very poor call quality.. unable to hear the voice of the caller, clearly and caller also unable to hear from my side.. Facing this problem just after 10 days of delivery.After spending a this much of money, totally,disappointed to buy this product. Don't go for it."

You can find batter than this..Go for Normal Bullet Z For More Battery and Batter Call Quality..
"There are some annoying crackling noise in the background, majorly during the low frequency sounds. Just run a headset quality test audios and then you can realise it easily. I replaced the product and the second one also got the same issue, then I requested for refund."

 Quality product, goodfor office use"
I'm using this product from 3 months .. it was good in the beginning but now cracked sound is observed during calls only.  Rest for music and movies it's good . But for calls I don't like it much . No performance at all . Not worth for the price
Decent bass good sound quality...Calls are also good ...Good job op...keep rock
Very very waste this item.. because of blutooth connected phone & bullets but bullets for sound.. phone for sound..i purchased 4 months.. still these problem continues..so this is check nd purchase..my version this is waste money product
"The Audio Clarity is very bad, the sound cracks - with constant disturbance while listening to the music and also while speaking on the microphone.Would have returned it back if possible."
"This product is just waste money ... It's sound quality, cancellation is not up to the mark as per expectations from a such a brand. Now one ear bud got defunct ....Plz be away from this fake product"
After 5 months of use experience connectivity issue and not get detected by any device because not show any Power also not charging light when connecting to cable provided with earphone.
No Bass .. high terrible... it pick all the noise from around.. No noise cancellation.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Overall it is a very good product . sound quality is awesome and build quality is also very good.but price should be around 1500 is justified"
Very Nice Product bought on 2nd Oct writing review after 1month..I am sony fan was using wx series sony bluetooth. Post purchase this enjoying it wort to buy it. My overall review 4rating
"Mic was not functioning properly from day 1, I contacted Amazon and told them the issue, They asked to reconnect with the devices.. Still having mic connection issues, also no noise cancellation."
everything fine. except for the fact that they downgraded the older version.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I used exactly 8months ,not completed 1year ,..... but LHS side  bug not working ,....!"
"Pro:1. Range.2. Price.3. Fidelity.Cons:1. Disconnect too often, like in every 30 min if you're watching a movie. Haven't faced this problem during calls2. Not suitable for gaming. Audio lags."
Quality is good. Battery backup is very good. Sound quality is upto the expectations as per the cost of the product.
Amazing bluetooth headphones with very good bass effect and quick charging batteries.Will reccomend for all rough and tough users.Only the cons I observed is the short length of wire. OnePlus Bullet blows the guns...
I'm using it daily I'm comfortable with it's performance and battery backup.
"This is the best bluetooth headset I have ever had, I tried many previously not naming any brand but this one just tick every single requirement I had. It's worth every single penny."
"Only on call using this headphones disconnected several times, main purpose we taken to attend call via headphones but receive call and multiple times disconnects"
This collar is very comfortable to use but not as great in terms of battery cuz battery get's drained easily by the accidental yet daily turning on of the collar
Again I would say Sound quality is best and no one can beat the sound or price in terms quality by OnePlus. This is only the best.
"It's very nice handy, powerfull product. Battery life is very good, handy to use"
Ear fit ok but there's no bassBattery backup okBass lover go with infinity glid 120 for good Bass compared infinity this oneplus bulles is a normal edition they only mentioned for sales tricks
The battery did not last even for few hours. And within three days it completely stopped working. Had lot of expectations from this product but based on my experience I would say DON'T BUY IT.
"writing this review after a week of usage, headphone is very good, initially faced connectivity issues while attending calls, (switching from bluetooth to earpiece) later it got connected perfectly"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I use it while driving,sound is good enough but the noise cancellation is not working working properly a knocking sound is there to second person."
Don't buy.. Connectivity problem.3 hai mere pass 3  ko replace  kiya Hai Or  .. Product problem Hai 3 ho 100 apko 1-2 achhe milenge overall worst product don't buy
"Sound quality is best , Bluetooth connectivity is very fast n good quality , don't buy if you are looking for noice cancellation"
Honestly I bought it with the hope that it would have quick switch like the older version.  Otherwise I think this is a good product fast charging and longer lasting. But lack of the quick switch feature is a HUGE let down!!
"Product is good at the initiatial stage, after 10 days i am facing charging issue .if possible please replace the product."
Decent SoundGood BatteryBut Connectivity issues.. Sometimes mic doesn't work.. Since 15 days my Bluetooth mic is not working...Average noise cancellation
"In 15 days of use , in call getting crackling sound. I want to replace this product.kindly give me customer care number or whom to contact for replacement."
Connectivity can be sometimes a headache..otherwise it's a value for money product
"Not genuine material, second copy was available on all online platform, if you want trusted quality then buy on oficial store directly. I'm not satisfied with this product."
Its only and only good for voice calls.Battery back up is very bad.There is very less control on the buttons of earphones.My earphone's mic stopped working after 3 weeks of usage. So in this budget this is not good earphones. Try other brands.
Sound and bass quality are amazing but when it comes to noise cancellation I donno why people in phone can hear my surrounding sounds even the sounds are from lit bit distance from me
Product is good in terms of soundquality and bass if uh are looking for listening music its a best product buy it!!But if uh are someone who is looking for noise cancellation for better call quality its poor dont buy it.
Ear phones are too good. Good quality.Good Bass qualityGood battery backupWill get nice music experience
"Dont purchase, i am only 2 months used and outgoing sound stopped"
"There is a frequency variation while attending calls and receiver hears buzz noises.Apart from that,the sound quality is great and battery life also good.The packaging was good and received with no damage"
"Sound distortion and connectivity problem with the black varient.I also have red version of these earphones that's sounds pretty well but this one is soo disappointing product, not expected with the OnePlus brand."
After a month network connectivity issue started..... Voice calls were distributed.....Nice cancellation isue is tooo much
Totally very sharp and clear but i am purchased this item last 7 days ago and now it is not work properly if i off this headphone then sound automatic on in earif this problem in one headphone then its ok i will change my product if totally headphone this type
Sound quality not good. Performance not satisfied. Ofter one day use speaker sounding differently
"First of all thankz for my friend for suggesting me this item, sound quality is best,almost the 100%perfect one for music lovers.i was about in doubt before purcjasing this item nut after i got it, i am tottally happy with it🥰"
I ordered this and get a defective piece having noise issue in background. Then I replaced it. In replacement also it is having alot of noise in background. Not expected from OnePlus
Sound quality and noise cancellation is really good but it has issues pairing with Spotify or gaana. Basically often unpairs itself which is quite irritating sometimes.
After one month usage I write this. It's a best friend for music lovers. For general usage guys notice this I don't know when I charged in last time it's still have 40% strength.Boss is also so cool 😎👍
Product is good but they have not given extra buds in the pack which I received
"All good, except the battery... Full charge goes for 5 to 6 hrs, not sure about the long run"
Overall good puchase ....Bass quality is ok not goodProduct quality is good
The product is most worst one which I buy from Amazon. The headset get damaged within one week...when I claim the headset the company rejected ..and they told me that the headset has been cracked...this is the most worst product
Sound quality is good. Receiving call is easy and voice clarity is good.
I'm new to this kindof gadgets and it fulfills my requirement so I'm okay with it.
"Review after using for 3 months : Overall, a very good quality product.. battery backup and charging time is also as same as that mentioned in product description..."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 After replacing again I got Very poor quality product which is not working. Screen recording is attached for your reference. Don't ordered this product from Amazon buy it from store."
I also tire of sony but the quality which is not available in sony earphone 4000 that quality is in this 2000 earphoneMere hisab se isse acha earphone is price me milega hi nahi
"Build quality excellent, charging backup excellent, ruf & tuf using,"
I would rather give 0 star. Please dont buy. There is no quick switch option available for this price. Voice is also not clear while in meeting.  Difficult to switch between gadgets. Pathetic and unhappy with amazon as product return is also not taken.
Other than bass it has lower build quality than that of the normal Z.This does not have the switching button between two devices.I would suggest you to buy the normal ones as it has better built quality.
One of the best earbudsSound quality is awesome❤️Bass-09Treble-10Battery backup-10Clarity-10One of the best product to listen to is music in this budget.I am just loving it❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I like the product as I expected but only charging is not in expected hours rather than that everything is good
"Truely Value for Money Product... ""Boat"" give you bass, but fade the vocals and treble, but One Plus gives you very clear sound, u can differentiate each instrument... with Decent and Balanced Bass! true music lover will definitely like One Plus"
"Awesome just missy he old edition becz it has many features too 😒 like dual connectivity and  and seperate buttons for volume and audio was also good in older version ,still in market this product is excellent 👌"
Sound - 4.5/5Bass - 3.5/5Charging Speed - 1/5Battery - 4/5Connectivity - 4.5/5Oneplus Service 0/5
"Sturdy durable and reliable, just that earlier button of switching devices is removed"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It's been only 7months bought this oneplus bullets bass edition.. and safety guard of left ear piece joint was teared.. and then ear piece stopped working.."
while ordering this product i expected thst it will recieve in very well condition and with every accecerios mentioned in the prodect detail.. and later when received the product. the package ing was in wrost condition and also didn't have some in ear accessories.
"One plus has definitely done a good job. overall quality of the product is very good but i will give it a 4 out of 5 due to it,s sound quality . Bass is excellent but can be improverd in sound as well to give a rich quality sound to ears."
"Noise problem observed when I used my Redmi phone, after visiting service centre they replied need to update your mobile phone 2019 model. (After I used my new model phone 2021 it is ok)."
Worst experience with these premium earphones...even not compatible with OnePlus mobile phones...u can't talk on phone with these earphones..some background sound always disturbing u... buttons not working properly in changing the tracks... please don't buy...
I had ordered this item because I wanted quick switch & dual pairing feature. Both of these don't seem to work. There is no quick witch button alsoSuper disappointed with One plus
Average Build quality. Very lengthy wire and bulky battery pack. Never satisfied. Also it stop right speaker with in a month.
Very bad experience i want replace it i bought it 20 days ago and now there is conastant noice coming whenever i call someone
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Worth every penny"
Liked the build quality & ease of use.Missing dedicated button for switching between devices.
Bought the product at 1799 at great Indian sale. Didn't live up to expectations. Sound quality and battery is not good compared to non bass edition.
"Its a very nice product. It possessing its specifications what was the company mentioned. Its battery backup is best, music listening is best, everything is super. Just buy it and feel it"
"Older headset was good with mic facility, this new bass edition is waste in noise cancellation and lot of noise in between the long calls. In one word, feels like this is the duplicate product of 1+"
"Started getting crackling sound during call,it has not fixed even after resetting the phone  or headphone.it is a known issue with thjs band,so please donot buy this item,r"
Good quality. But I am not sure if it is water proof that can be used during rain because charging point is open for water to affect. And mic did not work on falling in water. As usual Rice bag helped :)
Had been using sony earphones for more than 2 years. Sound quality was way better than these. Not suitable for music. Noise cancellation is a sham in these.
While on call our voice is not audible for another person..If the Mike is near then only they can hear our voice..And Mike is not near to speak also
Good product... Value for money... Nanum nallah irukunu kelvi pattuthan vaangunen ipothan use panni paatha aprom than theriuthu romba nallah product... Realme and boat vida ithu better quality.
I am so disappointed in this product after using this for 9 months i can tell these earphones only last for 10 months.
The Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition Bluetooth in Ear Earphones with mic (Black) are excellent sound quality
"It produces some kind of noice when on call. I got a replacement product, but the problem existed in the replacement product too. This is a newer version of the product and the previous version was really good."
The product was awesome since for a few weeks..and all off a sudden it's making some fuzzy voice and not getting connected to any device. I was not even given a warranty card so that I could do something with that. Now I don't know what to do.
Hi I bought this product before four to five months. But left side ear phone is not working properly not able to hear the sound . Can u please look in to this and as it is warranty can I get replacement.
"It become faulty after 3 months of use, I took replacement from one plus stores. After 1 year of use it again became faulty. No replacement so I have to buy another pair, bought other brand this time."
"Hii all I'm using these earphones last 10 days these earphones is good for listening 🎧 for music and as well as classes,coming to charging section awesome,quick charge,very comfortable and finally these earphones for these price segment"
The only problem I face is that its bluetooth connection faces interference from my laptop's 2.4Ghz wifi connection when connected to the laptop. Otherwise everything is good for the price.
"I bought this for 1.8k and quality is worse that a substandard 900 headphones. I thought it was jsut one off defective piece but even after the repalcement , the issue persists.Better to buy boat headset instead of this one"
Highly recommended everyone to this productJust close eye's and purchase itBass this excellent & Sound quality is too goodLove this product ❤️
"The sound quality is very poor. I do not what happen now , when I used this bullet wireless to call some one they always complaint that my voice is coming very bad. I want exchange this. Can hou help me"
but there's no 2 device switching option for non one plus devices.
Its not even working with OnePlus 9R for Gaming while playing PUBG mostly my mic is not working my teammates are not able to hear me..  other than gaming it's working good..👍
"Don't buy one plus item, there is less number service cebtre. I am from MP, here  service centre is available in only 5 district out of 51 district. So I am getting problem to repair my earphonePlease don't buy one plus item"
"Best for calling. Good noise cancellation. Automatic turn on and turn off. Good battery back up. Go for itBass is not good, so not good for music, but best for calling"
I bought it on 26 march ..it work well for 13-14 days after that it is getting diconnecting itself even you are in front of paired device... the sound gets buffered sometimes due to connectivity issues .
"Battery backup, connectivity and sound quality are best.Go for it"
It's quite good but 'Quick Switch' is not there in it which is the most biggest negative point or you can say because of which I don't like it.Sound cancellation is just kind of myth I can say as it doesn't work that good.
Mobile is connected with bluetooth. But the call voice is on ear piece only.Sometimes by default it disconnects while we are on callNot to buy at all
"After use of 8-9 days, it started making static noise and it is very frequent. I cannot return it now because the return window has been closed. very disappointing experience even after paying 2k INR. 🙂"
"Very good product, worth for money, i enjoyed a lot with music as well call, very good design for regular use and one request from my side is need to give some rubber or platic for close the charging port"
"This product have so many defectsFirst I brought it then it have a mic defect So I replaced the product ,then the new product have a button defect that when  I press the volume button it have a crackling sound ."
Sound acha he....Noise cancellation avrageBass quality goot but not too goodBatry only 1.5 day (heavy use)Batry boat me achi he
This is only for music not for playing games or for calls there is some worst background noise on the other side they won't be able listening your voice please don't be for calls or playing games worst product that I have purchased
The earphones are excellent. But the right earbud stopped working without any reason in 6 months. And there is no replacement warranty too. Disappointed that a brand like OnePlus can stop working just like that.
A background score is getting played in loop mode eventhough there is no song or app is open. Tried to reset multiple times and tried to connect to other phones as well but still the problem persists.
"I have purchased it as a gift , and now i came to know that its work only when plug into charging .. Can’t expect this from the huge brand one plus .. i really dont know what to do next , as its useless for anyone ."
It was working fine with my one plus mobile but when I switched to my laptop the audio was not even clear and after I reset it and directly pair it to laptop it worked nicely for 5-6 min but then same issue with a lot of noise.
"while making calls, the receiver hears a ringing noise and the conversation is not understandable at the other end.  Its a horrible experience for the receiver while making calls.  not using the device anymore after 2 months."
"It continuosly disconnecting while playing PUB G. I think Amazon has shipped my a defected product or this is a normal issue while playing pubg. Though I am using oneplus 7T pro, it's sound got mutted after every 5 minutes."
"Sounds quality is very good, instantly connected to device, if you not use then headset is gone automatically in sleep mode it will save our battery, and battery quality is very good."
1st time send newspaper and second time send used product.i purchase one plus ear phone and send used boat product in OnePlus box.
"Poor quality, its ear buds r painful for ears better buy any other brand"
Battery last 4 hr onlySo poor performance
Using from more than 2 months and no complaints so far. Get charged very quickly and can be used throughout the day once charged.
The only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 star is the crackling sound it produces sometimes. Other than that it's just awesome like in every aspect.
buy this headphone only for its charging speed.sound quality is avg.frequent disconnects while using it.sometimes pairing issue can be seen when battery is low.
Missing dedicated switch key. Also there is glitch everytime you increase or decrease volume. Battery backup is the biggest flex. Enough volume and bass ~good sound quality.
Sound quality is as expected. Great bass and clear sound. Call quality is great too.
Call receive button problem after then old edition better performance call receive button....
"I have been using this earphone for a couple of months, bass quality and sound quality, connecting speed is very good but the connecting range is not good. Quickly charge and no need to recharge too early.  Honestly, it's worth buying."
Just Go And purchase this is All time Best Product..... Never before Never afterIt's NEVER SETTLE
Sound starts lagging after sometimes when I play and video music or watch any movie on Iphone. Not sure if this is the problem with only iphones or other phones as well.
"Truely worth the money. Good sound quality, bluetooth range. Best feature is quick charge. Charges close to half withing 15 mins. So no hassle in case battery is low near to meeting time 👍"
After using it for more than a month I am constantly facing the connectivity issue. Initially it was working fine. But after few days this wrong thing happened to start.The Bluetooth gets automically disconnected.
"Excellent battery life, charges quickly, and the magnetic disconnection function is my favourite.. sound quality is great"
Nice Packing. Good Bluetooth Headset. Good Sound and Bass. Sufficient Battery backup. Recommended.
Amazon is selling duplicate products of top brands headphones is making disturb nois no one can hear voice on call. And Amazon refused to take it back pathetic service.
I have used with an iPhone X and iPhone 7 but sound quality is very poor. Lots of cracking sound in the background while playing music/ YouTube videos . Not recommend for iPhones . I have received a replacement but still problem exists
Awesome earphones.. Bass quality is superb.. As they say 100% noise cancellation.
Best sound quality.Best quality material.Durable
Its priced double than other popular brands but not worth buying for extra bucks .. you get no extra features.. buy boat instead below 1k and decent noise cancellation.. better than this for sure
"Not good at all.Whenever connect to phone, it affect to Wifi and Mobile internet connectivity.Automatically both wifi and mobile internet get disconnected or work slower.Really bad product. Frustrating from day 1"
"It's not working properly, after full charging it is getting off automatically and when we put in charge light is showing after removing it is not showing may be battery problem i think"
In This Price Range It’s A good product by one plus . Sound quality is good . Bass is also good . Noise cancellation is average but overall is best in this price range . Build quality is also good . 4.5 Star Put Of 5.
Sound quality is very good and external noise cancellation was pretty decent given the budget. The quick switch is not as expected and it's kind of similar to the usual switching between one device to another
Got a blue colour one although I ordered black one still thought to keep it but worst decision ever made now it seems like a fake product as it automatically switches off and on really disappointed @Amazon
Don't buy if you expect long life. I have tried two pieces with same model one is black and red one. Both doesn't lost long. It just works for 6 months. Cable quality is poor. Don't go for this.
"Easy to use but it had compatibility issues with the devices other than one plus, sound is distorted while calling....I have been facing this issue since the start...."
I'm loving the product... Bass quality is good... Its not that high but its nice... Over all sound and noise cancelation works great... Simply superb... Loving it 😍😍😍😍😍
"I had used one pluse bullet before, they worked great. These are fine but they are very slow to connect to mobile on the go. Hence not enjoying for office work"
When ever I spoke with others some distrub sound came both a end. Now I m using only hearing music only. Retun time completed no way to exchange this.
"I thought music on with OnePlus neck band but literally feeling like near to sunOn calling its is wrost i ever seen a product like thatPreviously i used boat, jbl, and samsung those are v good comparing to this"
Good sound quality. Go for it
"There is lot of disturbance (noise) in speaker while talking with it, This problem will come in One Plus too and it will come so soon, we didn't knew it. We need replacement of this as soon as possible."
Worest device made by one plus company u can't able use on bike it's. Too worest experience my suggestion don't take the 1 stvthey made good but now they bult a mic in the frame u can't able to talk...tooo worest they made
"The only thing I want in this product is the best quality in sound quality and should develop a little bit.  The company and the word which is twitter, which is chick chick chick sound, also has a little bit of it."
Currently using I'm using 2 phones samsung M40 and oneplus nord goes perfectly with both of thm. It's a bit more swifter with oneplus nord. Genuinely has great battery life and sound experience.
"Bass is good. Sound quality for the music is not that much great. Some times, some disturbed sound is comming through the right earpiece while attending calls. It would have been better if they include a mute button as well."
"try to switch on blutooth, but not on  after replacing same product but Blutooth not on same problem i am face in both blutooth"
You can use on bike and rush places alsoIt’s giving good quality
"worth buying it if you are a OnePlus user, its giving handsome performance if you're one of the OP usee"
Hear music and watch movies with good quality sound but whenever you call sound echo is bad problem. I have reset phone and earphone many time but there is persistent problem of echo
The headphone performance is good but Within 2 months the headphones sound quality decreased and While you speak there is irritantinf disturbance. I will not recommend people to buy. Poor speaker quality
Pathetic product... Not last for even 1 day...  Don't waste money on it... Even after full charge not working... Not worth buying...
After 2 months of use it was showing problems... Voice is not coming from both sides🥺😥😥😥😥😥Waste of money and it shows warranty of 1 year. And I am not able to replace it
It's just. 10 days completed and one side earphone not working some time not connected automatically .... It's very bad products I don't want to give 1 star also ... Not received proper product very disappointed...  I want my money back...
Likes :-Sound qualityBattery back upCharging timeConnectivityDislikes:-Noise cancelationNoise cancelationNoise cancelationYeah noise cancelation is not good in this headphones
Really good in sound quality.Woth for 2K .Recommended for purchase.
headphone & sound quality is too good.. but noise cancellation is too bad.. speakers are frequently complaining about background noises and also about voice is not clear..
"Products no worries, but delivery Thursday has date but still Friday this one of disappointed.....today 23,,eveingtiming to sounds prblm"
Ek dum bekar hend free hai bike chlte time iss bt nhi kar pta hai bs iska sound hi badiya mere dost nay bhi li thi oski dusre din bd hi calling karte time robot ing awaj aati hai
Good for call purpose however they disconnect on regular basis.Also in middle of the call you may loose voice.But it’s manageable.
"I was lil doubtful after noticing the dirty tape instead of the company seal but when I opened it, earbuds were full of ear wax. This terrible experience was never expected from sellers on amazon"
I received delivery on 21 june 2021.But yesterday i.e 11/10/2021 this product neither on/off nor connect to blutooth of any device. So I am not satisfied from this OnePlus blutooth
Worst product not worth to buy after 10 days observed left side wire problem not a reliable product never recommond it
Connection Was Not Proper. When I am Connecting With Wifi On Its get disconnected all the times. When I am Using Mobile Data Its Good. But I donno what's the problem. So I am asking you to look into It.
"after 15 days of the order received the battery is not working properly. Only half an hour on stand by mode. I thought Oneplus was a good brand and opted for this headset, but this is too worst regarding the battery."
1.I love this Product💝.2.Purchased in Republic day sale with 1800rps  price.3.But little disappointing thing is no quick switch button & noise cancellation is very poor.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Super sound quality amazing design excellent buttons"
"Total waste of money bought OnePlus head phn previously, which was good. But this one is useless it will disconnect automatically after sometime. Sometimes it wont show in bluetooth."
"Sound,quality and fits perfectly in the ears"
Easily useful for my work. good product.
Not much difference which local players
Purchase date 12th August but not working from day one . I thought there is a issue with phone . But it is working fine . When we connect bluetooth . Calls are not audible for other person. Pls don'buy . Not worth for money
There is a lot of static disturbance while using these bluetooth head phones. Tried a factory reset and re-pairing....no improvement.
"I did not have any expection, but literally sounded better than my wired shennheiser ones"
This wireless neck Bluetooth is so good its built quality is pitty nice battery backup is average it charges so quick and sound is so good and its comfortable as well
Sounds quality is good but not that good compared to other in range buds however it does feel premium. Battery is not good too. Noise cancellation is fine although other person can hear some sound of the sorrouding.
"The product is good but I have issue in this product so where to do complaint is not mentioned and no local service office , I have issue of voice breaking and not proper  work.so kindly guide or resolve this issue."
"I like the quality of the product ... But sometimes sound crackles alot..though i replaced my first neckband for the same crackling issue and got the new one, but sometimes it crackles too still I'm using by reseting it."
"Not recommend for gaming, 2sec delay, calling ,sound qulity and connectivity to good"
It doesn't have anything to show whether the device is on or off.. Very poor connectivity. Over all a horrifying experience. Waste of money to buy this product.
Yes I use the product and the bass was to good and classic 👌and totally good❤ In under Rs 2000/-But I got this product in offer Rs1825/-
Very bad quality of earband recieved. Very low battery backup and poor sound quality. I did not like it
"one of the good earphones with ergonomic design, no pain in the ears from prolonged usage( this might vary from person to person). Bluetooth response is pretty good."
Can’t give a review because i have bought for someone else.
Nice product. Nice build quality. Battery backup not bad.Sound quality better than any other earphones.☺️Nice bass
"Everything is good. I personally find it difficult to switch between devices as bluetooth must be turned off in one device before using it in another. Sometimes, it takes time to connect."
Need to replace is not working properly
The main product is okay but I don't know if  Amazon opens the boxes because I have not received the charing cable or any extra ear tips to fit my size.. This irresponsible behavior is highly inconvenient for me
I was most disappointed that It doesn't support dual pair. And if you don't habe a OnePlus device you may not experience the best quality. But still the product is good. I wont say it cant be recommende.
"During the call voice quality is very bad.During the call, the voice comes out loud, which makes it difficult for the other person to understand.I totally unsatisfied with one plus."
"A decent product for the price. Bass is not that heavy but enough. If you're a heavy bass lover, you won't be satisfied. For normal music lovers, you will be satisfied. Overall rating 7.5/10."
AWESOME PRODUCT ONEPLUS 😍😍😍PUBG LOVERBEST ONE PLUS
"Call experience is very bad, i have tried it in different mobiles, but same problem in all mobiles"
Sound quality is good but only the big problem in this when i connect it to system for office meetings others cant able to hear my voice so its totally uselless product for office purpose
"I have been using one plus from 2012 & to today I am also using one plus 8, ordered one plus  head phone after 12 Andiorid it is not working kindly help as I have spent Rs.1999"
Awesome quality earphone with good bass quality and better noise cancellation. Sound quality is just perfect!! Overall value for money. Recommend to buy this product
The earphones are good in this segment
"Doesn't connect to BT dongles very well, with phone works alright"
""
From long time I was looking for a good earphone and finally got the right thing. Happy with the product.
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Sound Quality is Good , Quick PairingBass Quality is Ok Not excellent.Value for Price"
Ok ok product......
"Mic some timmes not working, Voice getting break while talking over phone, Blutooth getting disconnect automatic, lots of time did reset but problem not solved yet."
"-Product is very good , sound quality is good- Noise cancellation is not that good- Battery life is more than 6 hours-product touch and feel is very good"
I thought it was waste of my time because this product is not working properly and also amozen customer care not responding properly for returned items & refund amount details ...
Battery backup is very poor in this price amount range battery playback time only 10 hrs and many brands below this price range is very good battery backup upto 40 hrs in just 1499 rs
I want to return the product because it is not connecting with my dell laptop.
It was working good for first three weeks then i started having problems of buzzing and sound tear. The problem was having in iphone 6s& iphone 10.But when i took my brothers android phone there was no problem at all.
After some time mic stopped working and now looking for replacement but not able to find any related service or online pick up. How do I replace it??
I received a defective piece where sound ouput was different between left and right ear.Right ouput is lower than left output during soft musicKindly check once you receive the product.
"Less than a week into usage, product stopped charging unless I turn on the device and off again. Secondly, the audio output would randomly cease while playing YouTube or Amazon music."
"I like this earphone, best quality...!!"
"Everything is good but mic is not very good,"
"Pro:1. I love magnetic on/off, quickly connect to device2. Good battery life3. Light weight.4. Quality built, good wireCon:1. Doesn't noted."
I have bought this product 2 months before and it completely stopped working in 2 months.  Initially stopped working one side then completely stopped. It is expensive and there is no quality. very disappointed.
Very long battery life and quick chargingSound is also very good
having hard time pairing with device it does not get on even after multiple tries does not get connected yo the devices and no lights work to see whats going on with the headset m sure this is a fake one
After 10 days use It is generating noise while calling.Now I am stuck because the replacement period has been over.
"Sound quality is nice.... Battery backup is not as expected... Doesn't make much difference with other bluetooths, even boat has very good battery backup then OnePlus bluetooth"
Crackling sound continues
No problem with the product so far. Very fast charging. Good connectivity. Overall great product.
Bluetooth connection is very poor. It will take time to connect when we unattach magnetic buds. Some times we have to connect by choosing bluetooth device.Realme buds work better here.
I am very happy to buy it...i am buying it for my partner and he is very happy and giving me feedback that it's so nice for sounds and easy to access...nice products...

 Quality of the product need to update... Paying 2000/- rs.. Not 100 or 200rs..If we pay 2k and not evening using 20months!!!"
Excellent.. it should have more power backup and 13+mm driver
"I purchased this product in september, but microphone was  defective and i replaced it within a day. new one only worked for 2 months and it left speaker stopped working."
"When I first got the product, I experienced a lot of disturbance and crackling sound during calls. I got it replaced, and the same thing is happening. I had high hopes with this, however it's the worst product!"
"I liked this product because of its fast connectivity, battery life ,and sound ..it captures minute sound ,after 6 months of usage one of the speaker stopped working.."
When I call someone in crowd. Receiver says that very noisy sound hearing.
Average sound quality with boom bass. Battery backup is good....this is for who wants bass....but I like balanced audio and quality so my choice under 2000 OPPO M31  best and upto 5000rs no one beat oppo......
"Very low quality used 5 month. Headset not working. During warrent period send for repair, they are saying have physical damage and not given warrenty. Really cheating"
Battery life was not enough as it was told that 17 hour and sometimes it was came a beeping soung and encrypted music so it was very bad thing I was experienced
Don't buy this product........ mic problem....
"First my husband bought boat but it has some connectivity issues, battery life is not good.... So skip to oneplus it's more better than boat"
It's having good bass.just need to improve its ear fitting.connectivity and range was amazing 😍 little bit improvement in battery life 20hr was to less feel the music
Good battery backup and easy to carry in pocket and around neck. Good Bass. 5/5
Dislike  because this item had brok 😒 I am not able to listen  the noise  because wire is not work properly 😑  1yerar warranty bt I am not able to return or replace this item
"It would have been better if the volume buttons were seperate.. like the non bass edition.. It's only required if you are much of a ""bass kind of songs"" or else the non bass edition is better for wfh or other works"
"Light weight value for money. Fast charge , battery backup excellent"
Ph call noise problem
In my previous one plus BT there was a quick switch button from where both the connected device can be used. Same was mentioned in this also but don't know how to switch & from which button. Of possible plz guide..
The earphones are truly superb. Worth every penny. Just go for it. As usual Amazon delivery is prompt. I am just loving my earphones
Good sound qualityGood product price wise
"All things in this neckband is amazing.You can blindly trust on this, no issue when play bgmi.Don't think too much go and buy this beastOnly thing that I didn't like is delivery boy he was so rude ."
"Defective product was given but until I recognised it it was too late to be returned so I request not to buy it. I dislike this product,defective part delivered. Not a trustable shop."
Nice and good value for money
"After 10 days of use, started getting continous noise during call. Its unbearable to use it while talking using this earphone, noise sounds is continuous all the time"
"Try to grab a deal during sale or special offers , worth the money !"
Very nice earphone i just love it😍🥰 very clear sound quality n nice bass
Thank you OnePlus for such a wonderful headphones. Good battery standby & Sound quality.
It's very good 👍 product. I was very agressive before getting.It sound quality awasome and product quality like speaker and wire also beautiful ❤️.

 Earphones: Not working"
This product all over good but problem is disconnection using continuous 2 - 3hr. Sound quality is the best but some disturbance during playing songs like listening on FM radio.
Something was defect in your  product then I was return this product... But av tk mera refunf ni aaya hai... Mujhe ab replace item nahi chahiye... I want my refund... Plzz refund my balance
I started listening old songs too much... With OnePlus bullets. You have to spend atleast ....between 4-5k to get this level of sound quality.
Bought these first in August 2020. They stopped working in April 2021. Then exchanged them as it was in guarantee period but the new ones also stopped working in now.  Its a scam and very disappointed in Oneplus!
"This is much better than others, If someone is looking in the same price range then it would be a better option to go with the OnePlus Bullet wireless Z bass edition. I like sound quality with bass."
Go for it if you have a professional work to do and want reliability in your meeting for audio connect and sound quality
"Battery last 2 daysSound quality is nice , not a big bass lover so it works.Really light weightCharges quickly in 15 min"
"Build quality is great. Sound quality is not that awesome, but you can't expect the best sound with SBC and AAC codecs in Bluetooth earphones."
"Not even one month and I am facing issue in calls. Noise due to bad connectivity while calls, totally disappointed with product, not even getting return or warranty details. Also, unable to replace"
Sb chij badhiya hai bsss ek kami h dual device pairing ka option ni h
Build quality is good.Sound quality is nice.Working very well with oneplus smartphone.Value for money product.Go for it.
Dislike after completion of six month it's taken too much time to charging and discharge in just 5-6 hours. Over all bad experience with this product not happy below star rating from me side
"Frequently going to sleep mode if you are not using and takes time to activate , very bad quality for the price. Every time I have to disconnect and connect again ..."

excellent product
Sound very loudi don't  like this bassDidn't get return policy i sold this am not using because  sound quality very bad and loudI think this is fake
good although noise cancellation can be improved
Getting crackling sounds even though it is replaced once after purchasing for the first time. You can have oppo neckband over this
Good earphone.
"Totally value for money product. Superb sound quality (including bass), build quality, brilliant battery backup. Absolutely worth it!"
I was able to use for more than 10 days without charge. ie) the battery doesn't drain when it's idle. Overall the best!
I had purchased this headset on Dec 2021. Sound & base wise ok but voice is not while talking with others. Please guide me to replace headset as this is in waranty period.
I used the. For more than 3 months they are only good for battery life as they are not so good in bass sound quality is okay .
I bought this for me but this is useless product. Even though these don't exchange this product. Not worth it don't buy this product.
Mic totally useless.
Good
Good product
"Sound quality was average, Mic was not working, Bass quality was deteriorated. I returned this product 2 times. Hope!! One Plus will deliver good quality product again for which it is known."
There is crackling sound in background most of the time. I replaced it and heard crackling sound again.
"Don't buy it. I bought it on may, after 2months its not working properly bluetooth is  connecting but not for d calsAnd now it's lot of disturbence while talking d cals"
"Bought this on a deadline to be used on my trip,but sadly charging issue or system issue don't know.I was highly relaying on one plus quality but sadly the accessories have been disappointing."
"To Enjoy Music, the Product is fine. But not suitable for Calling purposes. Keep getting cut in between. Connectivity Issue."
its bery good but one of ots have not hearing i am using this with iphone 12 pro max it is very compatible for ios and showing battery percentage easly auto connected
Excellent product
One of the best buy I had ..excellent product
Good sound
After a month there is crackling noise during calls and is too irritating as you cannot hear what the other person is saying . It disconnects in between and takes a minute to reconnect .Waste of money
No showing quick switch feature. Even after feature and detail option shows it's there but product doesn't have that. Wrong information provided.Don't buy if you want to use quick switch feature.
"Awesome product, specially battery backup is very impressive. Sound and audio quality is also fabulous"
Best headfones
Amazing product. Great sound quality very easy operation. Best the auto switch on and auto connection feature that makes it different from others
It is simple to use and the clarity is beyond compare
Don't ever buy this product.. I used it for 10 days and now it's not charging. My earphones battery is now fully dead.. worst product.. buy this product is a big mistake and totally waste of money
noise clearance is very  bad and in I am playing the video voice breakdown I am not expected from these product I have paid 1999 it is a not small amountI dislike the Bluetooth
The sound quality and build quality is simply superb very flexible  the things that I observed is while listen the songs when we try to increase or decrease the volume some disturbance os occurring
Good One
Great sound quality. U will enjoy watching movies and hearing music. Recommended.
I brought 2 ear phones left side ear phone stop working in 30 days hate 1 plus

 The product Died within two months"
Box I have received in which there is manual guide no red cable club welcome card no warranty card what is this ..this is the joke of company
Within 4 month headphone got dead. Now it's been 1 month I have submitted that headphone to service centre for replacement still they are saying we don't have stock. This is the Worst experience
"Everything is good, except the problem of one side speaker is not working since 4vdays...."
Very good sound quality
very nice bass
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Superb product with excellent sound quality  and bass."
Some crackling sound heared on calling.Customer save tell me this issue in phone.And Your phone software is old.Please don't bue if you have 1 year old phone.
Good quality wireless earphones. A power button would have helped a lot though.
Nice product....good battery life....good on/off feature.....fast contesting.....bass something low but almost good
The voice clarity is very good which means a lot.  Listening to songs on this headset seems to be floating in the air.  I do not know how to say more than that.My thanks to one plus and amazon
Superb
Please I request not to buy this product there is not clear voice and also after one week there is no chance of exchanging the product also and crackling sound is more don't waste your money. Am Highly disappointed.
Good for the price. Can't hear on the top volume . To get comfortable sound need to keep volume on middle..
I'm Satisfied with this product and one plus services I'm using this one year so good quality sound bass so go this product
Battery life is good
All are awesome but having connectivity issue... Sometime its not connected or not visible in pairing device.. Also if m scaning its not found... Having this issue continuously..
once charged...forget for three four days
"DO NOT BUY...  just 2 months not working / not charging atall..  Tried for warrenty claim , but no option found for claim. its worst experience!.."
I seriously don't like it with brand promises with big name and work only for one month and now it is dead it's not working anymore
"Bought twice, there are noise disturbances that don’t go away, some sort of glitch, crackling sounds in between playback like when adjusting radio frequencies on a radio"
They add in discription with mic but I got without mic and with all bad qualities.
In 2nd month it just got switched off and couldn't restart it again
I am using this one from last 2 months. Very Easy to connect and converse in phone calls . Good sound for listening 🎧 songs....Very flexible to connect multiple devicesGreat to go for one plus
"I have been using the same product earlier,but never faced this problemBut now the new one has connection problem while talkin ,other wise everything is same .Got it changed once but the problem persists."
Worst product for income and outgoing calls it is only used for listening 🎧 music waste ..Don't Buy This product I request Everyone Not To Buy
मेरे को गलत आइटम भेजा गया है जिसकी कंप्लेंट मेने पहले से ही कर दिया था लेकिन उसके बावजूद भी कोई समाधान नहीं हुआ है जिसके में कंज्यूमर कोर्ट में रिट लगा रहा हूं अगर मेरा जल्द कोई समाधान नहीं हुआ तोप्लीज
Good but Old model is better it is single button to used. Under 1500Rs cost price better
"Clear sound quality, noice cancellation work's perfectly, battery backup is good and charges quickly.Trouble when switching between mobile and Laptop. Should support double pairing or quick switch."
Don't buy this headphone for gaming purpose
There is crackling sound while hearing on phone. Not a good product as it seems to be.
I dislike switching option is not there which was in old edition. Otherwise it's nice product.
Good product
Good battery backup plus clear sound with bass
Bad experience with Amazon and one  plus  bluetooth headset purchase this product in previous month November  now December 3rd December not able to use just because  bluetooth not working
हमने बातचीत करने के लिए ब्लूटूथ इयरफोन का प्रयोग किया लेकिन यह मात्र 2 महीने में ही डैमेज हो चुका हैब्लूटूथ कनेक्टिविटी नहीं हैआवाज किलियर आती जाती नहीं है
When you connect it with iPhone there's crackling sound.Buttons don't respond.Charging issues.Not worth buying
It's battery life and sound quality is good but sometimes connection is problemSometimes connect and some disconnect automaticallyFacing problem with connecting to device
Good
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Nice earphone"
"Everything about this is nice the sound, the bass and the texture feels really comfortable. Lightweight. The sound and bass can be better but it is a good in this price range."
"Nice features, it switches between 2 devices seamlessly with stable connection, battery and call quality is good, no bass, I doubt if there is any noise cancellation."
After 2 months perfect battery backup but when you call someone voice is not clear to the other side 😑😒
"Sound quality + noise cancellation everything is good,but when we connect 2 devicesEx- one plus 7 & a macbook, the switching is not all smooth + the sound is distorted"
Not compatible with my redmi phone...very low sound..returning it back..dont buy if you have any other phone than one plus
It has got no direct switching functionality.
I recieved a wrong and defective product and delivery boy deny to puch up return very bad experience with this totally  money waste and now I m facing so much in progress of return
My Bluetooth stopped working within 6 months. When I tried reaching One plus for replacement under warranty they did not entertain my concern. Worst service

"Battery is amazing, but the sound quality is not that top notch like crisp and clear. It's the 'Bass Edition' thats must be the reason. But overall the product and is build quality is 🔥"
"Clear sound,long last charge back up.Great one plus."
This earphone disconnects a lot while calling with iPhone. Does not allow me to speak even for a min. Disappointed with the purchase. Saw different blogs and it seems similar problems faced by many.
Iss jaisi bass aur clear volume kisi bhi earphone ki nhi hai it is bestttttt.....Agar kisi ko lena hai toh full paisa vasool hai aankhe band kar ke khareed le aapa paisa waste nhi jayega
"Sound is not clear, cracking sound comes after few days uses, I also replaced the product but the result is same, not recommende, go with  realme or other brands."
Nice qualityBuilt structure awesomeBullet in ear fit to earC_type cable charger
I am facing charging issue in my One Plus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition only red light shows while charging for a long time. Kindly replace the product.
Battery backup of this earphone doesn’t meet my expection.Bullet wireless has more battery backup than bass edition.Overall its good except battery backup

worth for money & Excellent product to use
"The build quality is good. Personally, I did not find the sound quality up to the mark, plenty of room for improvement. Great battery backup, easy controls and no issues while on calls"
Noise cancellation issue ...Double device not connected ...Sound ok ...Bass ok ...Not use on bike ....
The left earpiece stopped working in 7 months. Is there a warranty replacement available for this product?. Good sound quality although...
It's a faulty product.no warranty given.fake product.
I have bought one plus bluetooth but after 1 week I am facing problem there is connecting problem and also voice is lacking and no body is helping from one plus so please don't buy.
"After one month, mic not working just using for audio, if you visit customer service centre they tell lots of stories and tell like mistake with you"
"Three after using this I'm replacing this.Some sound similar to a small tick can be heard which makes this neckband unusable, Let's see if the replaced one is good."
"The Quality of the product is not up to the mark,the sound crackles like a bubble wrap continuously also they DON'T HAVE A RETURN POLICY,if they do have Kindly Contact me.Regards"
"Battery percentge showing only in multiple of 10 like 100%, 90%,80% and 100% to 90% is only for one call its getting down soon. Cqn you replace this item soon"

I only got the charger in the box. The earphone is missing. I have recorded video while opening the box. I want refund.

Amazing bass
If the purpose is only music then best one to go.Want to use for calls then don't consider this.You will get cracking noise during calls..
Good product which has a decent sound quality.Battery backup is just awesome. Charging time also very less since I'm using OnePlus dash charger.
"Received a fake and cheap product, and now I am not able to return the same as amazon is asking for image verification, which can't be possible without receiving original product."
Pure quality stuff
Excellent Product... Sound Quality is excellent. Smooth in ears..Bass Quality is Good... Original Product is delivered.Battery Back Up is Good..Value for Money
Awesome product mind-blowing thanks Amazon for giving original productNahi to r bhi online application h sab original k nam p.local product chipka dete h
Not bad. Average product.
As we all know that @oneplus is pioneer in making good quality gagets .It has a great sound quality and are comfortable...Nice fit in ears
The mic picks up too much wire rubbing noise when used while walking or working
Great buy but it is showing some problems in ascepts of charging not getting charged since yesterday night

I'm so happy this One Plus Bullet Wireless Bluetooth HeadsetSon Nice ProductThank u One plusAnd Special thanks For Amazon...
Sometimes during connecting voice will be distributing but mostly it is very good
Should have a manual switch off and on button cause sometimes those magnets stick together and the earphones are switched off while we are using.

 I am disappointed this time from Amazon such a well known reputed organization because I got damaged used product which is even different product."
I think I Have got a defective piece of product. Lot of electrical noise which may be due to defective components.I want replacement as I trust the brand till now
Best blootooth
This headset is not working after 2weeks.Just emitting dim LED and not getting started.No response is coming back even if we press any keys...I wasted my money on this product
After month 1 side not working... No damage nothing.. just stop sounding.. money wasted
Everything is super...Must buy without any thinking... Value for money..I am fully satisfied... Thank you Amazon for first delivery..I got it within 5 working days. ..
Battery life and sound quality worst. I'm just praying for durability of the product
அதுருது

"No noice cancellation, sound quality is ok for music but very poor quality for talk on calling with any network.  Wrost experience , vaste of money"
The product is good. It fits well. Noise cancellation level is also ok.
Best headphone in these range. But need to improve built quality...last version of these headphones much better in built quality.
Very good product from oneplus. I feel it is satisfactory product. Very less time it takes to charge. Sound and backup is also good

"Exactly on the 8 th day ,one side of the bullets stopped working , there is no sound frm the right side and I am not able to replace this nor repair this , it was completely a bad experience for me ."
Takes 15 minutes for 100% charge and runs whole day. Sound and bass is also nice.
"The Cable broke within 15 days of purchase, just 5 days after the return/ replace period. never expected from a brand like One plus"
Not working
just ok
Average product
Thought of taking it as I use one plus phone only but it stopped working in 15 days. I keep charging it but it doesn't start at all. can't change it as it has crossed 10 days now.
How can I replace my bluetooth I have purchased it on aug but now it Turn off automatically while using the bluetooth plz help me with this issue
"This is supposed to be the bass edition but the bass is missing with a lot of treble. Poos sound quality. Defective, duplicate or simply a bad product, could be any."
My husband like this
Sound and Bass quality are good.Battery is the key mention for this headset.Compared to any other product in the same range this is the best.
The sounds good but the problem is that the mic isn't working at all. And it haven't even been 24 hours. Decided to test out the quality of the mic but it didn't work at all.
"One side earphone is not working,it's 9 days old unit. Received on 18.08.21,I am trying to raise a complaint in call center but it's not connected, worst product,overall service is not good"
This is not OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition (Bold Black) headset. This is a fake product which i got it after it was delivered. So I've returned it. Check out the photos

 Bluetooth connectivity issue"
I have received item but with in one week got some issues not working returned
The media could not be loaded.
With in 2month voice breaking issue. No ervice station in all districts. Very less service senters only available in TN. Trichy servicecentre response is very bad.
Recieved a fake product with different design than original one & morever it was defective one..what is worst is that amazon is not helping with its return ..overall a pathetic service
"Product built quality is very good, but i am experiencing bad sound quality Bluetooth on whatsapp and other regular calls.Not at all happy."
Nice one time investment for this 🤠
Lil bit eco in the sound is annoying if takling on a call with only one bud.
"exept phone calls quality, everything is good. music + gaming (very low delay) a must buy."
Males buzzing sound during call. Microphone is attached to the neck band which is why you need to speak louder while taking.
"yes I like this Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z Bass very much. small small issues only, but overall good product."
Very good quality
Starting me sb thik tha but abhi connect hone problem aa rhi hOr base to bilkul nhi h isme
No noice cancellation
Earphone not working with my mac book laptop getting cracking sound and when i tried to replace it seller refused my request. So disappointed with such kinf of response.
Using Oneplus product for the first time.. very satisfying.. very attractive box.. and sound quality is very good.. recommend.. Thanks for the very fast delivery Amazon..❤
Excellent quality
"Worst product, with in 2weeks instead of noice cancellation it started giving noice to the receiver, very bad, it's not like previous quality!!!"
Excellent Sound quality with bassStand by mode is superb
Excellent 👌
its my second purchase quality of earphones are good and can use for longer time. I am happy with purchase
"At this price range,this is the best,built quality is amazing,high quality rubber,sound wise its promising."
Most important thing is sound quality is best part and bass both are superb.
Bad one. I hardly used it for 10 days and the return window is closed. The voice is becoming blurred now and then in between conversation. Not audible many a times. Please don't buy.
"Received a duplicate product. Found multiple damages on the body. Charging port is Micro USB, However the charger is USB-C. This is not expected from Amazon. Feeling cheated."
Excellent
My ears soon start paining after I use it.
Excellent quality. Super bass. Excellent battery life. What more needed to be expected? I truly recomend this one.
"Worst product it only works good for oneplus products.If its connected to ther brand devices like samsung and asus laptops, the cracking sound starts and poors the audio"
In this price range Oneplus bullets providing great sound & perfect bass
"Upto the mark, 3 weeks use 12 hrs play back time"
Bass quality is normal as compared to Sony. Incommig Call quality to be improved. No cover for type C charging port.
"I ordered Oneplus bullets, but i got duplicate item and its not working properly. Packing box and receipts are original but the earphones are duplicate."
"I bought it at 1799 in offer, quality of sound is best, also for calling its guves better output."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Headset is not charging and this happened jst with in 15 days only and I had never seen this type of failed product"
Not good but ok
Worth buying this product.its user friendly
साउंड quailty is very good .But Bluetooth connection problem.
"Both the actual item & replacement item showed same issue (rattling sound when connected to laptops).So, this is definitely a product level bug. Worst product from OnePlus"
"With reference to the price, this product is justifiable with a decent cost, quality is good and I am satisfied by using it on iPhone/ one plus and MI phones.."
Best one for bass users I'm using it 1 month and only bass lovers will enjoy and over bass so I always reduce the sound to 70% and it good to hear
Completely satisfied with this earphone with amazing song quality. Battery backup is also good. Easy to pair. Call was clear. You can go with this.
Value for money...Sound quality good.External noise completely bandManufacture quality is excellent. Over all the product is awesome.
Very comfortable. Value of money. You can use it for a long long time. Rubber quality is excellent.
A very very bad item. Suddenly dameged. It has not been Changed
"Sound, battery, comfort  everything is great."
Good product👍Best sound experience and best battery life👌
Go for it
"It's not in good condition, it's damaged at the time of delivery"
Best suit for oneplus phones.. amazing call quality
Average
I loved this product.
"Worst product it's very insult for brand one plus,after one month mic not working properly... while every call I want to disconnect bluetooth and take a call at normal"
very poor quality product I just used 3months but now lt is working
It’s a good buy. Charges up quickly in minutes … doesn’t take hours to charge.
Customer service service is not good.If any issue is raised the same is not solved.This review is after using almost 1 year.
Sound became very low even in full volume they didnt gave warranty card in packing now i can not avail warranty of my productDont buy one plus
Nice

 I will not recommend u to take this at this price, u may go to boat but can be taken around 1200"
"I now have two pairs. One for me and the other for wife. Mostly using it to listen Spotify and call. Great bass, great sound and clarity."
Excellent Product With Hearing Capacity..I Would Recommend This To Everyone.. Battery Life Is Amazing 👌 Keeps You Going For Hours Together.
"Every thing is goodI got it for 1999 rupeesReally goo product to buyIf we keep 10 mins charge, we can enjoy upto 10hrsRecommended one"
"It has fantastic sound quality, the charging lasts for many days * depends on the use. But for me it lasts for atleast 5 days. Highly recommended for one pluse phone users."
NICE
This wireless earphone does not connect with OnePlus nordBluetooth doesn't work properly it doesn't get connectedReally disappointed
Return period was over. Oneplus has only few service centers. So very difficult to get it repaired. Utterly disappointing 😞.
Value for money
Mere pas ek daimej product aa gya h ek  se thik achhi aawaz aati h dusre se bahut hi kam aawaz aati h Mai ese loutana chahta hun plzzz return it
"I have purchased this product in Jun 2021 and it is stopped working in Oct 2021,Not sure the reason but return policy is not good here, Pathetic Experience"
Good sound quality and even charge remains for atleast 2hrs if used continuously and best to buy
The product is not working. I think I received a fake product. But my return time window is also over so cannot get replacement.
"Don't buy this product from Amazon, this is duplicate and the battery is not working more than 4,5hr properly...😖😖😖😖N not excepting return request."
"Not buy,  sound quality is good but always slipping from ear."

 It is recharge problem, charge do not staying. I am do to  fully charged but used just 5 minutes charge is empty."
"little bit extra (whooh)  bass , it you can adjest in equliser ,  over all very good audio quality"
with this price range it is too good. Main thing is it's charging time ..you can can plug in it for just 10 minutes and get a backup of 10 hours that is really satisfying.
Sound is gd and also bass but no noise cancellation is thre and battery life is less so i m very sad about this product
Kuch time mai khud hi discounted ho ja raha hai/battery issue/kuch time baad hi voice atak rahi hai kat rahi hai
It's sound quality is very good and is worth of money
Sound quality is really good.
"Overll good now, should give regularly this product with customer services. Money also Worthfull for our india 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳 expectations....... All the best👍💯"
Battery backup very low compare with boat rockers 255 pro+
"This product was good but gradually its sound quality become worse, in calls sound is not clear, even one plus earbuds service centers do not respond"
Continuously disconnecting whenever paired. Not in any perticular situation. Very dissappointed with this one. Please let me know what to do.
"Does not connect often, it takes time."
Quality product. Sound is very balanced. Must buy
Sound is good but volume button doesn't work properly and volume button was broken if I removed the cover plastic over volume button.
Worst & No bass quality
"Good bass, super audio,high durability, worth money, 16 hrs play music, easy on/off mode."
Fantastic experience beautiful colour gone madThe only drawback I have is the keyboard and it's emojis otherwise the experience is fabulous
"Poor noise cancellation, while making or receiving the call not clearly listen. Voice breaking so many times and little more improve need in bass quality."
"Waste product, it’s stopped working within 10days of purchase and no return policy…"
Great Product.Excellent Sound effect.I love it.
Sound quality is awesome butOn call so much irritating sound
Bluetooth is no more connecting after 5 months of use. Boat Bluetooth is more worth buying and works longer than this
1no
Its been just three weeks since I brought this but one of the side is not wroking.. really pathetic.. added to that you cannot find a service quickly ..
"Sound quality is good, connectivity is also good but battery will only last for 9-10 hours max."
"Pathetic headphones, no quick switch button.. they are misleading the customers. Don't buy"
Sound quality is good. Connectivity is excellent. It connects automatically in a second. Gaming performance is also good. You won't notice any delay.

 Sound quality best 1 plus branded productsBass quality bestColour best black🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩"
"Often voice gets distorted when in calls but works perfectly when listening to music, etc. It's frustrating because my phone is also from the same company."
A really nice product from one plus. But it feels painful for longer usage
Best earphone in 2000 price range. No need to research just buy it.
Very bad experience with this ear phone ones charge will not last longer for more than 20 min and it's completely off again I need to charge fully to use it
"In Just one month, these headphones have already gone bad. Huge noise, disturbance and voice breaks during calls"
Dominating Bass ... if you go with full volume u can't enjoy the music. Ear drums will start paining
Amazing Sound Quality. Dumdaar Bass. Light Weight. Worth Price. Best bluetooth headphone available in the market. Battery wakeup is awesome. Totally a Masterpiece
Bass is really poor.Automatically gets of and takes time in getting on.Sound quality and mic quality is very poor.Battery backup ia satisfactory.
Overall experience was awesome
Very nice n clear
They aren't last long quality..
Best earphone under 2kSound -4 out of 5Bass-. 4 out of 5Clearity -5 out of 5Comfort 5 out of 5Black colour outstanding 🤩🤩
It's been only a month.. it's not working properly. There is a disturbance when I am on a call.. sound quality is okay.
Definitely a good product.Sound and call quality is really good.Battery backup is awesome.No problems in 2 month of use.

 I have Received Damage product Headphones wire is cuttingI have requested for return the product"
"Good quality,nice sound, everyone to buy this product"
Earlier one was great because in this Mic is much back so person can't hear properly as well to disconnect it takes long time Infact unable to disconnect many times.
31 December 2021 को मेने ये प्रॉडक्ट लिया था. अब 2 महिने बाद आज ओ अचानक से फोन पे बात करते करते बंद पड गाया. मुझे इसका replacement चाहिए.
अमेजोन ने मुझे ना तो प्रोडक्ट दिया है और ना ही मेरा रिफंड किया कृपा करके या तो मुझे मेरा प्रोडक्ट दे या फिर मुझे मेरा पैसा वापस भुगतान करे
One side ear bud is not working within a month of purchase. Nowadays online products are not worth to buy most of the time you will get used or damaged product.
Really good product. Compare to previous version of bullet Z this is really good. Battery backup is also good. It gives around 15 hrs of battery backup.
Every time I have to manully connect my laptop. Once I restart my laptop device not connect automatically. I have to go blutooth and pair again my blutooth headphone.
Good for music as echo sound there phone calls have little problem
"Connectivity, Battery Life, build quality, comfort everything is great expect sound quality too much bass I wish I could exchange it with non bass edition 😔😊"
Not working properly with laptops.I think some driver or software issue is.Need to update.I've tried with hp &dell laptops. But working fine with mobile
At 90% + volume kicks throws will unbalancedI hate this issuesWant solution

 Excellent ☺️👍"
Good quality headphone .once charging is full then it will working 4 to 5 days normal use of Mobile .
"Initially product looking amazing but after few months it's not working properly ,I think defective product delivered to me ."
"There is no zero Star option so had to give one Star at least, it continuesly disconnecting while in use waste of money also the service of OnePlus very poor"
I m so disappointed with this product I will never buy one plus or suggest anyone .with in one month it stopped working Please don't buy this product
I have used base edition earlier (which stopped working after 14 months). This one is having crackling sound (even with replacement).
"Don't buy this blutooth, beacuse after some days unable to connect with Mobile, automatically disconnected, India's third class Bluetooth"
Blindly buy product. Best in classss
Amazing product
Sound quality good but not long time work quality was bad
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Bad reception while talking over the Bluetooth (static voices)"
It has an awesome Bass and a decent call quality with a mind blowing battery life. The build quality is also top notch.
Quality is not good after 6 months use one side not hearing  .
Like the sound quality but uncomfortable for long use..
When connected with a device the connectivity does not maintain and the sound starts blurring.Worst experience from OnePlus
Costly
"The sound is good , its really not soo clear in higher volumes and it's a bit louder even in 3/4 sound . Its overall a good one to buy and has an excellent battery life"
Back to back 2 product delivered in dead condition first vivo v20 pro than after OnePlus bullets wireless z black earphone is delivered in dead condition.
The product stopped working within 10 days of purchase
Nice product but they are not giving discount
Value for money. Satisfied with this after trying some other products in same price range
It's a good earphone from OnePlus and it's overall good but they need to improve in the bass and increase noise cancellation
Mike kharab huwa ekahine me ...itma mahenga liya but risult acha nhi muje ye vapis Krna hai....nhi to kabhi mai Amazon se shopping nhi krunga muze ye Cheng krke chaiue
Oneproblem :-When I call someone ..sound dorp. I'm used 4 month ..🙁Almost good.
Amazing product.. Great sound..
"Bought this product one month before, but now one of its earbuds is stopped working. Waste of money."
Very nice product
Product is useless I bought it on 13th march 2022 and on 29th of it's not working properly there is a very irritating sound in background
"They claim its low latency headset, but its not. Can't play games with it.Mic catching surrounding sound more than my voice even if i hold it close to my mouth"
I have been using this product since last year and I haven't got single change in its performance and qualityThanks 1+ it really mean it
These headphones are exceptionally good.Excellent base and sound quality. Long battery life is plus-plus. Highly Recommended.
"Only go for with one plus devices, do not buy if you have samsung device or an apple"
Only dislike one thing that in new version OnePlus remove switching button. Otherwise overall product is good.
"Quality good, but it is not suit for my ears"
Not a great enthusiast in bluetooth headphones.This is my first BT headset that too from OnePlus.It proved its worthiness for that 1999.satisfied and would also recommend it for others
Good and excellent
Magnet quality is low otherwise it's value for moneyBest part is no delay in sound when you play games
The total sound quality and noise cancellation is brilliant and it's highly comfortable to hold in ears. The product quality is top notch.
i got my order delivered today and the earphones were missing from it  im really disappointed with it and i want my money back as soon as possible.
These are the best earphones. Don't go with the other brands .The only problem is that it makes clicking sound when bass reaches high in some song..
"Good built quality, battery life is good too. Call quality is excellent. Only complaint is about its clarity, not entirely bad, but could have been crispier."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Left said sound quality is not working properlyPlease replace this product. Tank u"
Very good
Good one not the best!!
Best for calling. Worst for music lovers. I have purchased it for calling purpose only. Cost is high.
"Is product pe kuch tym k bad call pe Bluetooth connect ni hota,,awaj pause ho jata hai"
"I brought this head phone but this head phone not working properly , so i request to return this product after 1 day  but does not responce"
I don't like this product defective product delivered and refund is not initiated yetKindly please refund my amount as soon as possible

It's very nice.This is my 5th order for OnePlus bluetooth
"I have booked this earphone on  09.06.2021  at Rs 1,999 . Its 27.08.2021 today and its only one side is working. I found it really bad😐😐😐 I dont know what to do now."
"When talking on the phone, the sound does not come rightThere is a nice sound when listening to the song but a very bad sound on the call"
Worth it really one pluss is unbeatable andAnd bass is awesome
Sounds are quiet clear and bass quality is one of the best it's quiet improved. Noice cancellation can be improved it's good but expect more of it.
"I'm using nearly 4 month's , now it's not working, some times Bluetooth connectivity very bad . it's like connected and within seconds disconnected, weast of money."
"The worst product I have ever purchased. Within one month of purchase, sound is not coming from one earplug. A very bad product and not recommend to anyone to buy this."
Sound is so balanced and so comfortable to wear...
There's a small 'tak tak' sound which is clearly heard at the beginning of every song.. and also during slow music.. it's annoying!! Leaving that the product is amazing!
It was very useful neck bandBest sound qualityHigh bassValue for moneyThe interesting thing is  it turns off when the earbuds conected together
Its not able to catch up your voice easily. You need to speak louder for that. I was having much more expectation but didnt proved that much

Bahut hi bekar product off ho jata hai aur on nahin hota battery uski kharab hai almost product very bad
This Bluetooth is very good quality of sound and bass i feel each and every song it's one of the best headset👌👌
It's super
Not great in noise cancellation... Every time I receive or call .. during conversation Got irritating sound ... Have to disconnect the  call  sometime..
It switches on/off along with the magnets and its super speed to connect to the phone works great.
good
I purchased one plus wireless z bass edition in july 2021 and after 4 months it stopped working suddenly. How can I claim for the warranty. Guide me asap..
A scratchy and disturbing noise on phone calls but not when watching YouTube videos. Great bass.
"The product I purchase can't work as I expected.i suffers Mike problem,so I want to return it.plz take return this product and my amount return me as soon as possible early"
Some quality is good ... Bus after 2-3 months that headphone not working properly ...wastage of money ..
Nyc wireless Earphone..super fast in connect with phone.bettery is okay (8 to 10hours)
Sound 🔊 quality is too good as compare to any other earphone 🎧.
Over all the quality is good but bass is not up to mark as I expected from one plus.
Super good bass.

Automatic disconnect after used of 7-8 month I got warranty 1 year of this product. please tell me how to replace this product or repair
Really like the headphones but they constantly keep disconnecting from my Samsung S10.
"Liked the connecting speed with mobile, bass quality is too gud, noise cancellation is not that gud, when in crowd it recordes more noise itself"
"Not working, they send the defective productReally bad experience from the seller"
Excellent
as per expectation
"Sound is ok, bass quality not good, it stop working in just 2 months... Bad product, don't buy it..."
WORST PRODUCT AS AFTER 15 DAYS WHEN I ATTEND CALL THEN THE RECEIVER HEARS LOTS OF DISTURBANCE AND PATHETIC PERFORMANCE TOOO.
"I like changing is very quick, sound clarity initially ok after few days started getting so much noise during calls"
Buy this product a month ago.Long lasting batteryGood sound qualityFast connectivity
Nice product crestel clear sound and bass if you have bugget 2000 go for this sound quality is very good and confertable I m writeing after use one month
Excellent product
The brand comes up with another reliable product. Worth buying 👍🏻
This is a rip off of previous oneplus bullets 2 which were golden compared to this bronze the bass makes this terrible
I ordered new one but got delivered a faulty used product. It's not even starting. Requested for replacement let's see what will I get now. Very disappointed with service
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Hearing music. Sound quality too ordinary for music. Not able to turn on. Already button not working"
Wearing for long time it's not comfortable.Sound and build quality good
I am not satisfying with this product. In 2000 range worst wireless headset. Only sound is there no bass and no quality.
I don't like this kind of issues at all.This problem started after the replacement peroid over.How to replace it now is a big question.
Good product
You should buy this only if you are using one plus device  bcoz the response of this neckband with other devices is not good and the main prblm occurs on calling..
Sound quality is good
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Clarity of voice and connectivity with 2 phones is tedious and unsuccessful with this device."
Thank you oneplus sound 🤞 i like it that's product quality is very high i am impressed oneplus neckband
It's not like old one which they use to sell with name of OnePlus Z bullet earphones.
I believe in the One Plus product a lot and it's not good at all The sound of this project is very bad
Superb
Waste of buying 🙁😭😭 loss of 2000
Value for money. Using now for more than 2 months without any issues. Sound quality is superb.
Excellent Product...Great sound quality...using it since 5 months...loved it...worth purchase...Go for it
Best Headphones i have ever used..Premium Quality..High Bass..Top sound quality..Fully Satisfied Buyer..
I lost my old version. So bought this bass boosted one. Totally spoiled the decent quality of sound it offered in the older version. Utterly disappointed.
"Very awesome product by OnePlus, sound quality, noise cancellation & bass quality is too good and I’m loving it. Thank you Amazon!"
The quality of plastic is not good. It's broken near the volume button
Stupid product don't buy no quality voice break in between songs and two times I exchanged no use waste of money
Bass is good.
Bht hi mast earphone g 2000 ki range is se best koi earphone nai h bass bht mast h.or rating bh is range sbse jyada. Jisko bh 2000 ki range earphone leni ho to best h yeh👌👌

Good
If you are music lover this product is definitely not for you. A friend Have bough boats Rockerz 225 for 1000. They have better sound then this.
"Suddenly disconnect from my phone during call or listen music, noise cancellation not work properly, Issues in connectivity...."
Used old product has been sent . Very poor product.Bad bad baf
1.Good design2.Good sound quality3.Good Battery capacityBut it is better to charge the device upto the indicator turns into white as it lasts longer.
"Instead OnePlus , JBL product recieved and it seems it is a fake product.Strong action is recommended against this type of act"
After 3 months from my purchase. My left side speaker not working.
They are best amon or under 2000 but I think they are little overpriced than realme and boat ones over all happy to buy this.
Had to replace the item first as the mic was not working. The one I am having now also seems to have very bad mic reception
Good
Build and sound quality awesome. Pairing speed is unbelievable
Wonderful product
The best thing i liked about this headphones is it connects to the mobile device even before i plug it into my ears.
It's really owsam product and sound quality is very good with good base. Thank you oneplus of best products intimate ammount.
Must buy
"Bass quality and sound quality is very good, If anyone want Good bass and sound quality then i can prefer buy this Best product OnePlus."
"Sound quality is good,but while in call some buzz sound is coming and in addition too it is not connecting quickly."
Perform for musicNo noise cancellation
Good product friends
Awesome products
All over good but there is one problem I am facing after one month microphone was not working this was a very bad experience.
Love it!
I like it
Battery life is superb its charge very fast.. the thing is missing is not receiving incoming calls automatically in iPhone..
"Sound quality , noise cancellation , bass quality are awesome and also good power saving wireless 👂 phon"
Super bass qualityEasy to auto on off when connected to magnet
"It's good but noise cancellation is not upto the mark, also the bass is high.So overall this product needs little improvement."
All are ok but when are connected this device to Bluetooth then some after time it  can disconnected automatically.It can't connect continuously.
"If Product is not good then how is it possible sound quality, noise cancellation is good, think it."
Quality bad
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Pathetic product received .. not satisfied ... A strange voice keeps on keeping during call"
"This earphone is waste of money, whenever I'm connecting to PUBG and use it. The voice is not going and if it is going it's very feeble"
All know about one plus product. Its beyond my expectation. Its a very nice product bass of the head photo is wow.
Good but call quality degraded. Noise cancellation is not good at all
Very bad experience… crackling sounds from the first day of use… got it replaced twice!!! Same problem twice!!But Amazon gave a quick refund..
After correct one month of use.it suddenly stop working please help me to return or exchange it..worst headphones i ever use...
"The range has been reduced as compared to the previous model, and it doesn't have mic closerI liked the previous one moreIt was just perfect"
""
There is only one issue that it is slightly uncomfortable after 30 minutes of listening.
Missing that quick pair mutton from wireless z.Good improvement on bass .
Noise cancellation is as good as not there. The other person can hear when the slightest horn or bird chirping from far away.
"I got earphones on jun 21 and its nov 21, the left side of earphone is not working so I suggest to go for other brands and don't buy this product"
Easy to use.
Very sturdy design and built.

 Sound quality good.Bass quality very fine 👍Charge required online 10 minutes"
"I am using since 3 months, it was really a nice product. Battery life is awesome. Best product from one plus"
This is a really amazing product by one plus. Good battery backup. Charges in 10 mins which is really good for busy people. Value for money 👍.
"After the total charge is complete, no indication of light change"
"My product is not functioning properly, pls help to get this replaceThe right side ear bud sound is very low"
"At last time i brought the same that was good, but this time very bad quality wire and Bud's not good no comfortable product really I hate it 😠"
Connecting issue and righ side earphone not working after 10 days
👍
"Costlier than Realme, mi, boat and other brands but the money which you spend on it will be worthy for it."
"Good quality .... Sound clarity,bass ,design, fit, pairing device everything is good but noise cancelation while driving is not that much good."
Bought after waiting for some time.....Best sound quality..... excellent bassss....and also timely delivery by Amazon 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
It's overall okay but there should be more clear user manual so that there will be no issue while connecting with different devices and paring or unpairing
Very poor quality. Device stopped working in few months post purchase.
Giod
Hardly 1 week it worked fine . But after a week when I am trying to call someone. There is so much noise when ring goes to the other person.
So Nice
"Nice performance.The Brand Oneplus says everything.Worth buying.Thanks,"
"Not comfortable for ears, but other quality is good, battery in nornal use is about 2 day for some call and video streaming not continues."

Nice
Frequently disconnects from laptop.Tried with another laptop and its same issue.
Sound quality and base is good. Some time voice stop coming automatic disconnected.Overall experience is not good with this product .
Order the same item a few days ago with a sound better than the one currently ordered blutooth and its sounds and bass pretty very bad
Nice product
The built material is not goodMy band's one bud is not working in less than 1 year and one plus is also not ready ti take this issueSo plz don't buy this
Good one
Worst product from one plus product.i have even don't expect such a worst quality from 1 plus.plz improve a quality to retain beleive in 1 plus
Worthy product
"Sound quality is excellent, noise cancellation works very well.Connecting online for meetings is very satisfying for the attendees"
"Even after 3,4 hours of charging, red lights did not change into white, which indicate full charging.also some time charge very slow"
"Very nice sound quality, build up quality, noise cancellation quality, is very very very goodThankyou oneplusपैसा वसूल प्रोडक्ट"
The product has amazing sound quality. Beats are extremely clear and the connectivity is almost instantenous. Loved it!!
The best actually The beast In great sound quality.noise cancellation..what else .. u can buy blind folded..every penny is worth paying
"You are selling either dublicate or defective products. This will led serious consequence's in near future. Headphone not getting switchon, even after charging."
Bass is good and fit in ears.connectivity is excellent
Seems like fake product. Worst design. No power on/off button. I don’t know when it will switch on/off. Bass quality is poor.
Worst product . while calling connection problem . Voice can hear clearly
It is not too good as described. Sound and bass quality is normal as other low price earphones. But battery backup is best.
Mike is not working and sounds quality is very bad I'm not satisfied with this product
After connecting with system the incoming voice breaking.
"This is not suitable for voice, and auto diconnecting on calling time. Noise control 0 profomance. Don't buy for calls the only benifite is battery performance.."
This is 2nd one and within 3 months right one stopped working also the magnetic switch has stopped working too
It is not working properly..battery drained within one hour.Kindly look into this matter i have buy on 17 Nov 2021..
Missing switch button 😪
Microphone of this product does not work properly google it.. there are alot of complainsAnd it is not allowing me any refund rather replace it
The headphone is not working after just ten days
Great product. Noise cancellation works great. Fits perfectly.

I using this neckband is very poor sound quality. When I use to connect connect with Bluetooth it is not properly work.
"It's useless no noise cancellation function, sound quality not upto the mark... Price comparatively more than other brands with similar functions.."
Very Nice
"The media could not be loaded.
                



 When we make or receive any call, not able to hear anything. Worst product"
"Sound quality is average, but major problem is Bluetooth connectivity. Not a 1999 worth product...."
It's better than other Wireless air dopes but we love air buds... If you want to have wired just go for This. Awesome
Stopped working after 10 day. Even after full charge it will not contact to mobile
Overall quality excellent but with noise cancellation not satisfied
Sound quality is fantastic but the battery life of this headphone is not as given by one plus
*value for money*clear voice*flexible*deep base*power optimization if good*connectivity is too fast
For fifteen days initially after buying it was okay. Now not giving sound and wavering sound  . Kindly replace it or refund it
go for it
They are absolutely best for people who are doing work from home
I did not got one+ Bluetooth itself only accessories bill warranty card were there in box. Requested to return or replacement of this order.
"Premium product, Excellent battery backup, connectivity and navigation ..also very comfy to wear due to the flexibility of the cable"
Really good

"Good in terms of battery lasting, Sound is not bad, bass effect is lesser than expected.. Could have been priced 300 bucks less.."
Worst quality at this price range its better to buy under 1k because its quality is same as that
Sound quality is really good. Bass is enhanced in this edition. Sound distortion is negligible at higher volume
Good experience

"Keeps disconnecting for every 30 sec , need immediate assistance , checked in three four mobiles same problem is persisting"
Your product is old and damagedProduct is used by companyI am not satisfied with your product that’s why i returned you.

Neckband of a great quality. Oneplus is a great choice. Happy with the performance.
"Haven’t used yet, not getting started after even charging it to for 2 hours .Review very bad"
This product is not working
sometimes if we go away from mobile then some issue with voice while calling nd bass is not good at all just normal bass
It's not working properly on public area. Too much noise issue with called person so don't buy.
Not bad but noise cancellation is so worse kind and all this working well still.

The sound quality is really bad on some devices. I wouldn't recommend anyone buying these unless you just wanna use it with oneplus device.
"Good in all , it' disconnects every time when magnets are connected , auto connect is not 100% accurate , remaining is good"
Very good for travellers and also for office use. Good build quality and delivers good sound. I suggest not to use high volume
pakka quality high bass with clear sound no noise value for money
Mic properly not working
"Feeling good, unwanted noise reduction, good sounds nice product ever.... Have to buy it and trustable.... 😍"
I using for training and calling purpose the headphones creating bad noise i am not able to here correctly.
I dislike the charging time
After using 10 months it's sounds is burstingAnd after touching both speaker blootooth is not turning off
Overall its a nice product  worth around 1500/-
"Best earphones ever, great for taking meetings."
The cord is not as expected ..it will tangle in the neck together and difficult to remove it during emergency calls .. sound quality is excellent.

In this price Sony neckband are also available but their quality is not that much good and it's connectivity is excellent must buy products
"Not working properly automatically restarting, not connecting automatically"
Headphones are awesome no doubt directly without ant second thought go for it
Poor quality of body wires came out of earphone very poor mic very poor inception waste to buy and invest in like this …
